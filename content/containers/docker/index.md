## Installation

### [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) (incl. Pop!OS)

#### Option 1: Use apt-get

Set up `apt`:
```
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

Run apt install:
```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

#### Option 2: Use the convenience script

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh ./get-docker.sh
```

Use `--dry-run` on the script if there's concerns.

#### Run Docker as non-privileged user

```
sudo sh -eux <<EOF
apt-get install -y uidmap
EOF
```

Then

```
dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
```

#### Test docker

```
docker run hello-world
```

### [WinBoat](https://github.com/TibixDev/winboat/releases)
WinBoat is a lightweight, containerized tool that makes it easy to run Windows environments on Linux using Docker. It's like a portable Windows sandbox, but unlike traditional VMs, it doesn't bloat my system and, surprisingly, isn't resource-hungry. To put it simply, the Windows OS runs as a VM inside a Docker container, and it uses WinBoat Guest Server to fetch the necessary data from Windows. You can access it via FreeRDP (or a browser-based interface). This makes it flexible, efficient, and user-friendly.

From @Nick_Craver (Twitter):
> `docker run --rm -it $(docker build -q .)`

> Using the -q output (just the hash) from a container build, run it, then discard it (--rm) on exit.
> Overall: one command to build, run, and delete...without a tag and local image created while testing your docker build scripts. Neat.

:: Hello from Docker!
:: This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
:: 
:: To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
:: 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
:: 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
::     (amd64)
:: 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
::     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
:: 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
::     to your terminal.
:: 
:: To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
::  $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

:: now let's see currently running images

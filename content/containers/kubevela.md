tags=containers, architecture
summary=A modern software delivery platform that makes deploying and operating applications across today's hybrid, multi-cloud environments easier, faster and more reliable by being infrastructure agnostic, programmable, yet most importantly, application-centric.

## Highlights

KubeVela practices the "render, orchestrate, deploy" workflow with below highlighted values added to existing ecosystem:

#### **Deployment as Code**

Declare your deployment plan as workflow, run it automatically with any CI/CD or GitOps system, extend or re-program the workflow steps with [CUE](https://cuelang.org/). No ad-hoc scripts, no dirty glue code, just deploy. The deployment workflow in KubeVela is powered by [Open Application Model](https://oam.dev/).

#### **Built-in observability, multi-tenancy and security support**

Choose from the wide range of LDAP integrations we provided out-of-box, enjoy enhanced [multi-tenancy and multi-cluster authorization and authentication](https://kubevela.net/docs/platform-engineers/auth/advance), pick and apply fine-grained RBAC modules and customize them as per your own supply chain requirements. All delivery process has fully [automated observability dashboards](https://kubevela.net/docs/platform-engineers/operations/observability).

#### **Multi-cloud/hybrid-environments app delivery as first-class citizen**

Natively supports multi-cluster/hybrid-cloud scenarios such as progressive rollout across test/staging/production environments, automatic canary, blue-green and continuous verification, rich placement strategy across clusters and clouds, along with automated cloud environments provision.

#### **Lightweight but highly extensible architecture**

Minimize your control plane deployment with only one pod and 0.5c1g resources to handle thousands of application delivery. Glue and orchestrate all your infrastructure capabilities as reusable modules with a highly extensible architecture and share the large growing community [addons](https://kubevela.net/docs/reference/addons/overview).

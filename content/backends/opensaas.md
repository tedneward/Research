- 🚀 [Astro](https://starlight.astro.build/) - Astro's lightweight "Starlight" template for documentation and blog

Because we're using Wasp as the full-stack framework, we can leverage a lot of its features to build our SaaS in record time, including:

- ⛑ [End-to-end Type Safety](https://wasp.sh/docs/data-model/operations/overview) - Type your backend functions and get inferred types on the front-end automatically, without the need to install or configure any third-party libraries. Oh, and type-safe Links, too!
- 🤖 [Jobs](https://wasp.sh/docs/advanced/jobs) - Run cron jobs in the background or set up queues simply by defining a function in the config file.
- 🚀 [One-command Deploy](https://wasp.sh/docs/advanced/deployment/overview) - Easily deploy your DB, Server, & Client with one commaned to [Railway](https://railway.app) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io) via the CLI. Or deploy manually to any other hosting serivce of your choice.

"Build applications faster with object and file storage, user authentication, push notifications, dashboard and more out of the box."

[Website](https://parseplatform.org/) | [Github](https://github.com/parse-community)

The original. Open-sourced when Parse was bought by Facebook and then later shut down. Community version looks very active, and probably worth giving a spin at some point. Requires MongoDB or PostgreSQL as a data-storage unit, and optionally plugs in to Docker. Note that compared to the original Parse, Parse Jobs and Parse Analytics are not provided, but it's a NodeJS/Express-friendly tool, so that could/should be someting a NodeJS developer could implement on their own (or plug a third-party into) if needed. As a quick-stand-up backend, though, it should be more than adequate.

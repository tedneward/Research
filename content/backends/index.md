["What is BaaS?"](https://blog.back4app.com/backend-as-a-service-baas/): "you will outsource the responsibilities of running and maintaining servers to a third party and focus on the frontend or client-side development. On top of that, a BaaS will provide tools to help you create a backend code and speed up the development process. It has ready to use features like scalable databases, APIs, cloud code functions, social media integrations, file storage, and push notifications." "A backend as a service will provide you with features that can be deployed across all types of applications:

* Scalable Database (NoSQL or SQL)
* APIs (GraphQL and REST)
* Business Logic via Cloud Code Functions
* User authentication
* Social Integration (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)

* Logs
* CDN and Cache
* Infrastructure (Security settings, auto-scaling, data backup, DB optimization)"

["What is BaaS?"](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/backend-as-a-service-baas/): "Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) allows developers to focus on the frontend of their applications and leverage backend services without building or maintaining them. BaaS and serverless computing share some similarities, and many providers offer both, but the two models have several differences." ... "Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud service model in which developers outsource all the behind-the-scenes aspects of a web or mobile application so that they only have to write and maintain the frontend. BaaS vendors provide pre-written software for activities that take place on servers, such as user authentication, database management, remote updating, and push notifications (for mobile apps), as well as cloud storage and hosting." ... "BaaS providers offer a number of server-side capabilities. For instance:

* Database management
* Cloud storage (for user-generated content)
* User authentication
* Push notifications
* Remote updating
* Hosting
* Other platform- or vendor-specific functionalities; for instance, Firebase offers Google search indexing"

summary=A fast, simple and self-hosted backend as a service for your (web) apps, Open Source and free.

"Hoodie is a free and Open Source Software for building applications for the web and iOS. It is a complete backend for your apps, ready for you to get creative. It works immediately out-of-the-box: develop your frontend code, plug it into Hoodie’s frontend-friendly API and your app is ready.

"When you develop it, your app runs locally first, you can then deploy and host it wherever you want to. And if you want to extend Hoodie’s core features, you can check our list of currently available plugins or build plugins yourself.

"Hoodie is a noBackend technology — it's there for making the lives of frontend developers easier by abstracting away the backend and keeping you from worrying about backends. It gives you Dreamcode: a simple, easy-to-learn-and-implement frontend API built into it. Hoodie is also Offline First, which means that your app users’ data is stored locally by default so your Hoodie-based apps are accessible and usable anytime, independent from your users’ internet connection."

The benefits of Hoodie are:

* Focus on Node.JS developers that want to extend the product.
* Offline first concept. That is, users’ data are stored locally.
* Runs on Apache CouchDB.

No need to write server-side code or database schemas. Makes building offline-capable software a breeze.

Nitric is a multi-language backend framework that lets you declare infrastructure requirements in code for common cloud resources and provides a convenient interface to interact with them.

Using Terraform, Pulumi, or any tool you prefer, Nitric plugins automate cloud resource provisioning, security and linking. Nitric provides plugins for AWS, Azure and Google Cloud out of the box, then extend or build your own when things get custom.

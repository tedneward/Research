Redwood is an opinionated, full-stack, JavaScript/TypeScript web application framework designed to keep you moving fast as your app grows from side project to startup.

At the highest level, a Redwood app is a React frontend that talks to a custom GraphQL API. The API uses Prisma to operate on a database. Out of the box you get tightly integrated testing with Jest, logging with Pino, and a UI component catalog with Storybook. Setting up authentication (like Auth0) or CSS frameworks (like Tailwind CSS) are a single command line invocation away. And to top it off, Redwood's architecture allows you to deploy to either serverless providers (e.g. Netlify, Vercel) or traditional server and container providers (e.g. AWS, Render) with nearly no code changes between the two!

By making a lot of decisions for you, Redwood lets you get to work on what makes your application special, instead of wasting cycles choosing and re-choosing various technologies and configurations. Plus, because Redwood is a proper framework, you benefit from continued performance and feature upgrades over time and with minimum effort.

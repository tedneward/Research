summary=Chris Crawford's home for his thoughts on games and such.
~~~~~~

[Chris Crawford's website](https://www.erasmatazz.com/) is a good source of a bunch of game thoughts and insights. [Balance of Power](https://www.erasmatazz.com/library/my-books/balance-of-power-the-book/index.html) ([PDF](http://www.erasmatazz.com/MyResources/Balance-of-Power-the-Book.pdf)) was the most interesting game I could never get to play on my computer. I should read every one of his [Game Design](https://www.erasmatazz.com/library/game-design/index.html) essays at some point.

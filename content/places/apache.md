* [Creadur](http://creadur.apache.org/): This project started as just Rat, a release auditing tool good with licenses, coded in Java with plugins for Ant and Maven; it became clear that creating one uber-tool in one language is less useful than collecting a suite:
    * Apache Rat audits license headers — the boilerplate text needed in most source files. Coded in Java, it runs from the command line with plugins for Maven and Ant.
    * Apache Tentacles helps to audit in bulk components uploaded to a staging repository. Coded in Java, it runs from the command line.
    * Apache Whisker assists assembled applications maintain correct legal documentation. Coded in Java, it runs from the command line or as a plugin for Maven.
* [Curator](http://curator.apache.org/): a Java/JVM client library for Apache ZooKeeper, a distributed coordination service. It includes a highlevel API framework and utilities to make using Apache ZooKeeper much easier and more reliable. It also includes recipes for common use cases and extensions such as service discovery and a Java 8 asynchronous DSL.
* [cTAKES](http://ctakes.apache.org/): a natural language processing system for extraction of information from electronic medical record clinical free-text.

    * [Derby](http://db.apache.org/derby/): an open source relational database implemented entirely in Java
    * [Java Data Objects (JDO)](http://db.apache.org/jdo/): a standard way to access persistent data in databases, using plain old Java objects (POJO) to represent persistent data. The approach separates data manipulation (done by accessing Java data members in the Java domain objects) from database manipulation (done by calling the JDO interface methods). 
    * [Torque](http://db.apache.org/torque/): an object-relational mapper for java. In other words, Torque lets you access and manipulate data in a relational database using java objects. Unlike most other object-relational mappers, Torque does not use reflection to access user-provided classes, but it generates the necessary classes (including the Data Objects) from an XML schema describing the database layout. The XML file can either be written by hand or a starting point can be generated from an existing database. The XML schema can also be used to generate and execute a SQL script which creates all the tables in the database.
* [Daffodil](http://daffodil.apache.org/): Open-source implementation of the Data Format Description Language to convert between fixed format data and XML, JSON, and other data structures.
* [DataFu](http://datafu.apache.org/): a collection of libraries for working with large-scale data in Hadoop:

    * [DataFu Pig](http://datafu.apache.org/docs/datafu/getting-started.html): a collection of user-defined functions and macros for Apache Pig.
    * [DataFu Hourglass](http://datafu.apache.org/docs/hourglass/getting-started.html): an incremental processing framework for Apache Hadoop in MapReduce.
* [DataSketches](http://datasketches.apache.org/): A software library of stochastic streaming algorithms: In the analysis of big data there are often problem queries that don’t scale because they require huge compute resources and time to generate exact results. Examples include count distinct, quantiles, most-frequent items, joins, matrix computations, and graph analysis.If approximate results are acceptable, there is a class of specialized algorithms, called streaming algorithms, or sketches that can produce results orders-of magnitude faster and with mathematically proven error bounds. For interactive queries there may not be other viable alternatives, and in the case of real-time analysis, sketches are the only known solution. For any system that needs to extract useful information from big data these sketches are a required toolkit that should be tightly integrated into their analysis capabilities. This project is dedicated to providing a broad selection of sketch algorithms of production quality.
* [DeltaSpike](http://deltaspike.apache.org/): consists of a number of portable CDI extensions that provide useful features for Java application developers.

* [Fluo](https://fluo.apache.org/): a distributed processing system that lets users make incremental updates to large data sets.
* [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/): a template engine: a Java library to generate text output (HTML web pages, e-mails, configuration files, source code, etc.) based on templates and changing data. Templates are written in the FreeMarker Template Language (FTL), which is a simple, specialized language (not a full-blown programming language like PHP). Usually, a general-purpose programming language (like Java) is used to prepare the data (issue database queries, do business calculations). Then, Apache FreeMarker displays that prepared data using templates. In the template you are focusing on how to present the data, and outside the template you are focusing on what data to present.
* [Geode](../../storage/geode): a data management platform that provides real-time, consistent access to data-intensive applications throughout widely distributed cloud architectures. Geode pools memory, CPU, network resources, and optionally local disk across multiple processes to manage application objects and behavior. It uses dynamic replication and data partitioning techniques to implement high availability, improved performance, scalability, and fault tolerance. In addition to being a distributed data container, Apache Geode is an in-memory data management system that provides reliable asynchronous event notifications and guaranteed message delivery. Apache Geode is a mature, robust technology originally developed by GemStone Systems. Commercially available as GemFire, it was first deployed in the financial sector as the transactional, low-latency data engine used in Wall Street trading platforms.
* [Geronimo](http://geronimo.apache.org/): an open source server runtime that integrates the best open source projects to create Java/OSGi server runtimes that meet the needs of enterprise developers and system administrators. Our most popular distribution has previously been a fully certified Java EE 6 application server runtime. Now we are refocusing on providing JavaEE/JakartaEE libraries and Microprofile implementations.
* [Giraph](http://giraph.apache.org/): an iterative graph processing system built for high scalability. For example, it is currently used at Facebook to analyze the social graph formed by users and their connections. Giraph originated as the open-source counterpart to Pregel, the graph processing architecture developed at Google and described in a 2010 paper. Both systems are inspired by the Bulk Synchronous Parallel model of distributed computation introduced by Leslie Valiant. Giraph adds several features beyond the basic Pregel model, including master computation, sharded aggregators, edge-oriented input, out-of-core computation, and more.

* [Groovy](../../languages/jvm/groovy): a dynamically-typed programming language for the JVM.
* [Guacamole](http://guacamole.apache.org/): a clientless remote desktop gateway. It supports standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH. We call it clientless because no plugins or client software are required. Thanks to HTML5, once Guacamole is installed on a server, all you need to access your desktops is a web browser.
* [Gump](http://gump.apache.org/): a continuous integration tool. It is written in Python and fully supports Apache Ant, Apache Maven (1.x to 3.x) and other build tools. Gump is unique in that it builds and compiles software against the latest development versions of those projects. This allows Gump to detect potentially incompatible changes to that software just a few hours after those changes are checked into the version control system. Notifications are sent to the project team as soon as such a change is detected, referencing more detailed reports available online.
* [HAWQ](http://hawq.apache.org/): Apache Hadoop Native SQL. Advanced Analytics MPP Database for Enterprises.
* [HBase](../../storage/hbase): the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable, big data store.
* [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/): a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.
* [Helix](http://helix.apache.org/): a generic cluster management framework used for the automatic management of partitioned, replicated and distributed resources hosted on a cluster of nodes.

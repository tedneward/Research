    * Apache Rat audits license headers â€” the boilerplate text needed in most source files. Coded in Java, it runs from the command line with plugins for Maven and Ant.
    * Apache Tentacles helps to audit in bulk components uploaded to a staging repository. Coded in Java, it runs from the command line.
    * Apache Whisker assists assembled applications maintain correct legal documentation. Coded in Java, it runs from the command line or as a plugin for Maven.
* [Curator](http://curator.apache.org/): a Java/JVM client library for Apache ZooKeeper, a distributed coordination service.

DMN provides two tools for modeling decision-making: a graphical notation and an expression language. The notation shows the dependencies between a set of related decisions, and on the business knowledge and input data required to make them. It is simple enough to be readily understandable by all business stakeholders, including business analysts, designers, developers, and business owners. The expression language defines the decision logic underlying the decisions and business knowledge in sufficient detail to allow execution. It includes many convenient and expressive features, including decision tables, and is compatible with Java, PMML and ONNX. DMN is designed to be usable alongside the standard business process notation BPMN, and also ensures that decision models are interchangeable across organizations via an XML representation.

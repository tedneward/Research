summary=An Architectural Decision Record captures a single Architectural Decision, such as often done when writing personal notes or meeting minutes; the collection of ADRs created and maintained in a project constitute its decision log. All of these are within the topic of Architectural Knowledge Management.

[ADR Github](https://adr.github.io) || [joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record repo](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record) has a lot of examples, docs, and templates

An [Architectural Decision (AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. An [Architecturally Significant Requirement (ASR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecturally_significant_requirements) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software system’s architecture and quality. An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD, such as often done when writing personal notes or meeting minutes; the collection of ADRs created and maintained in a project constitute its decision log. All these are within the topic of Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM).

The aim of the GitHub adr organization is to:

Motivate the need for and benefits of AD capturing and establish a common vocabulary
Strengthen the tooling around ADRs, in support of agile practices as well as iterative and incremental software engineering processes
Provide pointers to public knowledge in the context of AKM and ADRs (for instance, this website)
Note: The term “architecture decision record” can be used interchangeably.

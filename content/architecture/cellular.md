["Cell-based architecture adoption guidelines"](https://www.infoq.com/articles/cell-based-architecture-adoption-guidelines/): "Cell-based architecture can be more complex to build and run and cost more. Not every system needs to work at the scale and reliability of S3; consider the use case and whether it’s worth the additional investment. It’s a good fit for systems which:

* Need high availability.
* Scale massively so cascading failures must be avoided.
* Need a very low RTO (Recovery Time Objective).
* Are so complex that automated test coverage is insufficient to cover all test cases."

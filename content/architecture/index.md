High-level resources/links around software architecture--styles, analysis, etc.

[The 12-Factor App](https://12factor.net/):
* I. Codebase: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
* II. Dependencies: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
* III. Config: Store config in the environment
* IV. Backing services: Treat backing services as attached resources
* V. Build, release, run: Strictly separate build and run stages
* VI. Processes: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
* VII. Port binding: Export services via port binding
* VIII. Concurrency: Scale out via the process model
* IX. Disposability: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
* X. Dev/prod parity: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
* XI. Logs: Treat logs as event streams
* XII. Admin processes: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

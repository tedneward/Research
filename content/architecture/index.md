["Don't Call It a Platform"](https://samnewman.io/blog/2023/02/08/dont-call-it-a-platform/): "Habitability, in the broadest sense, describes how nice (or not) the experience is for the people who have to live in a system. ... I make the argument that we ignore habitability at our peril. Those of us in a place to shape the lived experiences of our colleagues have a duty of care to ensure that we take their needs to heart."

[Platform Engineering Teams Done Right...](https://adrianco.medium.com/platform-engineering-teams-done-right-b3b3d4a8ad23)

[The 12-Factor App](https://12factor.net/):
* I. Codebase: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
* II. Dependencies: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
* III. Config: Store config in the environment
* IV. Backing services: Treat backing services as attached resources
* V. Build, release, run: Strictly separate build and run stages
* VI. Processes: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
* VII. Port binding: Export services via port binding
* VIII. Concurrency: Scale out via the process model
* IX. Disposability: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
* X. Dev/prod parity: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
* XI. Logs: Treat logs as event streams
* XII. Admin processes: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

* ["Architecture vs Model"](https://kalele.io/architecture-vs-model/): "One of the biggest problems with business software is that architecture gets promoted more than the domain model. Further, most domain models are ordinary, and could be implemented by school students for a lot less cost than the 7-9 figures often spent. Yet, often the software architecture supporting a model—almost certainly anemic—is generally over engineered."

The ABLE Group, headed by Prof. David Garlan, carries out research into software architectural approaches to:

* Improve the quality of software systems with new software architecture design tools, notations, and methods.
* Increase system resiliency, availability, and security through architecture-based self-adaptive systems.
* Reason about the design and implementation of cyber-physical systems and the internet-of-things.

Software architecture has a long history of research at Carnegie Mellon with strong groups in both the School of Computer Science and the Software Engineering Institute.

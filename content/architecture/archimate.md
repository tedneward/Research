 The ArchiMate visual modeling notation leverages your Enterprise Architecture practice and helps you describe and understand complex systems.

From ArchiMate 101:

**Why ArchiMate?** When I am asked the question What is ArchiMate?, I usually provide the same simple answer: A (foreign) language for Enterprise Architecture. But the real question people should ask is Why ArchiMate?. ... Before even starting to speak about ArchiMate, we have to widen the scope to the practice of Enterprise Architecture. Enterprise Architecture is about understanding the complexity in which an organization evolves and helping this organization to manage changes. In this context, "Enterprise" is not a synonym for "organization" but is the purpose (some would say the story) of this organization. Thus, as Enterprise Architects, we have to first understand this purpose and share it with all stakeholders. Then, the preparation work can begin and, again, we have to share it with all stakeholders.

*Simply put, communication is more than half of the work of an Enterprise Architecture practice.*

But if communication is such a big part of our job, then how can we make sure we are understood? How can we find the best way to communicate?

Cross-platform, true native. Tabris.js does not use WebViews for rendering the UI. Instead, it creates native widgets on the mobile platform via a JavaScript to native bridge. ... use existing JavaScript libraries, node modules, and Cordova plugins to build your apps. Tabris.js implements many APIs core to web applications, e.g. XMLHttpRequest or the 2D canvas. Create gorgeous graphs with chart.js, easily integrate underscore.js or access device features with Cordova device.

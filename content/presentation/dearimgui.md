Designed for game platforms, but I don't see any reason why it couldn't work for other things too.

* .NET: [ImGuiNET](https://github.com/ImGuiNET/ImGui.NET): An ImGui wrapper for .NET. Included is a basic sample program that shows how to use the library, and renders the UI using Veldrid, a portable graphics library for .NET. By itself, Dear ImGui does not care what technology you use for rendering; it simply outputs textured triangles. Example renderers also exist for MonoGame and OpenTK (OpenGL). 

Pros: battle tested / production ready, available on conan, minimal dependencies

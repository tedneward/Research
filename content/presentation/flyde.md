Flyde is a holistic solution for prototyping, integrating, evaluating and iterating on AI-heavy backend logic. It's a visual extension of TypeScript that runs in-codebase, providing the missing link between developers and non-developers working on backend AI workflows.

Flyde allows you to create visual flows for backend services like AI agents, prompt chains, API orchestration, and agentic workflows - directly integrated with your existing codebase. It includes a VSCode extension and seamlessly integrates with existing TypeScript/JavaScript code.

#### Who is Flyde for?
* Product Teams & Developers: Flyde bridges the gap between technical and non-technical team members. Product managers, designers, and backend developers can collaborate on the same visual flows, making complex backend logic transparent and enabling everyone to contribute meaningfully to the development process.

* Developers Building AI-Powered Backends: If you're dealing with complex prompt chains, AI agents, or multi-step backend AI workflows, Flyde provides a more manageable way to build, debug, and maintain these systems while keeping everything in your codebase.

* Teams Seeking Visual Clarity: Whether you're prototyping new backend features, managing complex business logic, API orchestration, or simply looking for a better way to document and understand your backend application flow, Flyde's visual approach helps you see the big picture while maintaining the power of code.

[Website](https://quasar.dev/)

Quasar is an open-source Vue.js based framework, which allows you as a web developer to quickly create responsive++ websites/apps in many flavours:

* SPAs (Single Page App)
* SSR (Server-side Rendered App) (+ optional PWA client takeover)
* PWAs (Progressive Web App)
* BEX (Browser Extension)
* Mobile Apps (Android, iOS, ...) through [Cordova](../cordova) or [Capacitor](../capacitorjs)
* Multi-platform Desktop Apps (using [Electron](../electron))

Quasar’s motto is: write code once and simultaneously deploy it as a website, a Mobile App and/or an Electron App. Yes, one codebase for all of them, helping you develop an app in record time by using a state-of-the-art CLI and backed by best-practice, blazing fast Quasar web components.

When using Quasar, you won’t need additional heavy libraries like Hammer.js, Moment.js or Bootstrap. It’s got those needs covered internally, and all with a small footprint!

With a few lines of only Python code, you can create interactive websites without any JavaScript programming. JustPy can also be used to create graphic user interfaces for Python programs.

**NOTE:** "justpy has been a great project and our goal to reach 1000 stars soon was reached now.
Given that nicegui is somewhat of a fork of justpy and is much more successful with >4000 stars there is not much use to try to build on justpy and move it further. Therefore I intend to close most issues now that ask for enhancements pointing to nicegui as an alternative that might implement these features and concentrate on helping people migrate to nicegui or keep their existing justpy code running for a while. justpy 0.13 seems to be sufficiently stable to not cause too many worries."

Install: `pip install streamlit`

Start an app: `streamlit hello`

Streamlit builds upon three simple principles:

* Embrace scripting: Build an app in a few lines of code with our magically simple API. Then see it automatically update as you iteratively save the source file.
* Weave in interaction: Adding a widget is the same as declaring a variable. No need to write a backend, define routes, handle HTTP requests, connect a frontend, write HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ...
* Deploy instantly: Effortlessly share, manage and deploy your apps, directly from Streamlit. All for free!

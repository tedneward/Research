> Cappuccino, a open-source web application framework in Objective-J (a superset of JavaScript which is transpiled for deployment but can also run in the browser directly), enhances app development by faithfully implementing the NeXTSTEP/Apple CocoaÂ® APIs for browsers as web browser restrictions permit. Leveraging this well-established architecture, Cappuccino facilitates scalable application development for those usage cases requiring developer productivity, reliability and sophisticated interaction support. Resulting applications are served from any web server and deployed to any modern web browser - without plugins or extensions of any kind.

"Metawidget does [UI generation] without introducing new technologies. It inspects your existing back-end architecture (such as JSON, REST, existing annotations, existing configuration files) and creates widgets native to your existing front-end framework (such as JavaScript, Java Server Faces, Android). Metawidget does not replace or restrict your existing UI framework. It does not try to 'own' your UI. Its Open Source license allows the use of Metawidget in open source and commercial projects."

Last update appears to be 2015; according to the author, this is due to maturity and personal distraction, but that "others have taken up the mantle" and points to ports to major SPA frameworks: [React](https://github.com/SDS-React-Metawidget/react-metawidget) and [Angular](https://github.com/AmitsBizruntime/MetawidetA2).

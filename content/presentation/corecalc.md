Corecalc is an implementation of core spreadsheet functionality in C#, intended as a platform for experiments with technology and novel functionality. Corecalc is a research prototype, not a usable replacement for Microsoft Excel, Gnumeric or LibreOffice Calc.

Funcalc is an extension of Corecalc in which users can define their own functions via sheet-defined functions, without resorting to external languages such as VBA. These are compiled to .NET bytecode at run-time, thus offering high performance while preserving the usual mode of interaction in which all edits take effect immediately. Funcalc is a research prototype.

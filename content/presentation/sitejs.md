> The Small Web is for people (not startups, enterprises, or governments). One person. One server. One site. Develop, test, sync, and deploy (using a single tool that comes in a single binary). Comes bundled with [Hugo](../hugo). Dynamic sites use DotJS ("PHP-like simplicity in JavaScript using .js files"), and includes WebSockets support as well. Comes bundled with [JavaScript Database (JSDB)](../../storage/jsdb) built into it.

**DivKit** 🐋 is an open source Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework. It allows you to roll out server-sourced updates to different app versions. Also, it can be used for fast UI prototyping, allowing you to write a layout once and then ship it to iOS, Android, and Web platforms. DivKit is an excellent choice to start using server-driven UI in your project because it can be easily integrated as a simple view in any part of your app. At the starting point, you don’t need a server integration. You can include all JSON on the client-side to try it in a real-world application.

Also, we’ve made a [sandbox](https://divkit.tech/playground) for you to experiment with. You can try different samples in the web editor and see the results on the web or in the Android [demo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yandex.divkit.demo), both of which are available on Google Play. We’ll publish the iOS demo app shortly. The UI in the demo can be updated live: the sandbox connects to the demo app via web sockets.

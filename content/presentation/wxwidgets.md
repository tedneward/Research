summary=A C++ library that lets developers create applications with a single code base and unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets gives applications a truly native look and feel because it uses the platform's native API rather than emulating the GUI.

[Website](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) | [Source](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets): "When installing wxWidgets on Windows or macOS, we always recommend building the library from source yourself, and only provide the source package for most platforms. On some platforms, we have provided a few pre-built binaries for convenience, but wxWidgets supports so many compilers on so many platforms, that we canâ€™t provide binaries for all of them. On Linux, we recommend using the official wxGTK packages provided by each distribution, but newer packages are available."

It has popular language bindings for Python, Perl, Ruby and many other languages,

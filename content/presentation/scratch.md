## Learning Principles
### Projects
People learn best when they are actively working on projects — generating new ideas, designing prototypes, making improvements and creating final products.

### Passion
When people focus on things they care about, they work longer and harder, persist in the face of challenges, and learn more in the process.

### Peers
Learning flourishes as a social activity, with people sharing ideas, collaborating on projects, and building on one another's work.

### Play
Learning involves playful experimentation — trying new things, tinkering with materials, testing boundaries, taking risks, iterating again and again.

## Design Principles
### Low Floor & Wide Walls
In order to encourage a varied and diverse set of interactions, we explicitly include elements and features that are easy for kids to understand (low floor), but general enough to support diverse uses (wide walls).

### Make it as Simple as Possible — And Maybe Even Simpler
Despite the common drive to add more features to software products, we have found that reducing the number of features often improves the user experience. What initially seems like a constraint or limitation can foster new forms of creativity.

### Many Paths, Many Styles
Many math and science activities have traditionally been biased towards specific populations. By paying special attention to creating accessible and appealing technologies, we are working to close the gap.

### Design for Tinkerability
We believe that the learning process is inherently iterative. Tinkerers start by exploring and experimenting, then revising and refining their goals and creations. To support this style of interaction, we design our interfaces to encourage quick experimentation and rapid cycles of iteration.

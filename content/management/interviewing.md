"The best engineering interview question I've ever gotten" [Part 1](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2022/01/06/memcached-interview/) [Part 2](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2022/01/07/memcached-interview-solution/): The challenge: Modifying `memcached` -- Via its `incr` and `decr` commands, memcached provides a built-in way to atomically add `k` to a number. But it doesn’t provide other arithmetic operations; in particular, there is no "atomic multiply by `k`" operation. Your programming challenge: **Add a `mult` command to memcached.**

[A Linguistic Comparison of Letters of Recommendation for Male and Female Chemistry and Biochemistry Job Applicants](https://www.oacd.health.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/linguistic_comparison_of_letters_of_recommendation.pdf): "Letters of recommendation are central to the hiring process. However, gender stereotypes could bias how recommenders describe female compared to male applicants. In the current study, text analysis software was used to examine 886 letters of recommendation written on behalf of 235 male and 42 female applicants for either a chemistry or biochemistry faculty position at a large U.S. research university. Results revealed more similarities than differences in letters written for male and female candidates. However, recommenders used significantly more standout adjectives to describe male as compared to female candidates. Letters containing more standout words also included more ability words and fewer grindstone words. Research is needed to explore how differences in language use affect perceivers’ evaluations of female candidates." (2007)

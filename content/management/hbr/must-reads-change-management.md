# Leading Change: Why Transformation Efforts Fail 
*John P. Kotter*

> **Idea in Brief**
>
> Most major change initiatives generate only lukewarm results. Many fail miserably. Why? Kotter maintains that too many managers don't realize transformation is a *process*, not an event. It advances through stages that build on each other. And it takes years. Pressured to accelerate the process, managers skip stages. But shortcuts never work.
>
> Equally troubling, even highly capable managers make critical mistakes--such as declaring victory too soon. Result? Loss of momentum, reversal of hard-won gains, and devastation of the entire transformation effort.
>
> By understanding the stages of change--and the pitfalls unique to each stage--you boost your chances of a successful transformation. Payoff? Your org flexes with tectonic shifts in competitors, markets, and technologies--leaving rivals far behind.

The most general lesson to be learned from the more successful cases is that the change process goes through a series of phases that, in total, usually require a considerable length of time. Skipping steps creates only the illusion of speed and never produces a satisfying result. 

A second very general lesson is that critical mistakes in any of the phases can have a devastating impact, slowing momentum and negating hard-won gains. Perhaps because we have relatively little experience in renewing organizations, even very capable people often make at least one big error.

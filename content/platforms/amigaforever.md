Emulation often gets a bad reputation because there's a thorny situation where retro apps and games are no longer developed and abandoned by their rights holders but still available to download and run in emulators. But Amiga Forever takes a different stance, as officially licensed emulation and preservation for the Amiga and its apps, games, and more. As such, it's the only operating system on this list that costs money, but it does come with every version of the official Amiga ROM and OS files, and it's even got an Android app, if you prefer to do your emulation on the go.

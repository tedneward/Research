Node.js promises speed, agility, and scalability. In practice however, doing Node right has been a challenge for engineering teams, costing their companies cloud spend, downtime, and time-to-market.
Time and time again, we’ve seen companies stumble when dealing with the same 5 issues:

* Scaling based on CPU and memory.
* Preview environment limitations
* Getting the right Node.js metrics
* Not knowing what will break or which teams you’ll impact when deploying APIs
* Figuring out which logger is right for you

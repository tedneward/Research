While most modern operating systems are sprawling beasts that eat up disk space, KolibriOS is tiny. It can fit on one 1.44MB floppy disk, which is a staggering achievement on its own to have modern connectivity and file systems. It boots in seconds, has hundreds of inbuilt apps, a GUI, and support for common USB devices like mice, hubs, keyboards, and flash drives. Oh, and it only needs 8MB of RAM, so it can run on almost anything with a CPU inside.

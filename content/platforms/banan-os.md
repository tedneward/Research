> Developer Bananymous has just released a new OS written from scratch that already supports many features of modern-day operating systems. Banan-OS reflects two years of effort by the developer and is written almost entirely in C++, with some 16-bit real mode assembly utilized for the BIOS bootloader. The project even uses Bananymous' own custom C++ library. Currently, the OS supports x86_64 and i686 architectures. However, there is no need to install it locally, as the developer is hosting a live example that users can use to see what it has to offer.

> Though still in its infancy, Banan-OS has several general functions that showcase how far it has come as a full-blown OS. These features include:
>
> * Ring3 userspace
> * SMP (multiprocessing)
> * Linear framebuffer (VESA and GOP)
> * Network stack
> * ELF executable loading
> * AML interpreter (partial)
> * Basic graphical environment

> The GUI is especially impressive as it features a terminal and a basic status bar. There are currently no applications or a program launcher, but those features are next on the list to be implemented.

> Banan-OS also features support for a host of different drivers, networking options, filesystems, and bootloaders that are sure to entice some collaboration efforts from other developers. The following are a few highlights from each of these categories:
> 
> * Drivers: NVMe disks, PS2 keyboards and mice, USB keyboards, USB mice, and USB mass storage
> * Networks: ARP, ICMP, IPv4, UDP, UNIX domain sockets
> * Filesystems: Virtual filesystem, Ext2, FAT12/16/32, Dev, Ram, Proc
> * Bootloaders: GRUB and Custom BIOS bootloader

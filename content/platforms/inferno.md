title=Inferno
tags=platform, operating system, concurrency
summary=An operating system created by Bell Labs that uses the same 9P distributed file system protocol (in Inferno lingo known as ‘Styx’), but can also run as a virtual machine on top of other operating systems as well as directly on hardware (specially well suited for embedded environments thanks to not requiring a MMU).

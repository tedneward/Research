"A low-code development platform provides a development environment used to create application software through a graphical user interface instead of traditional hand-coded computer programming. A low-coded platform may produce entirely operational applications, or require additional coding for specific situations." --[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform)

"Low-code is a software development approach that requires little to no coding in order to build applications and processes. A low-code development platform uses visual interfaces with simple logic and drag-and-drop features instead of extensive coding languages. These intuitive tools allow users with no formal knowledge of coding or software development to create applications for many purposes like mobile apps and business apps.

"These platforms have become increasingly popular as a fast and easy alternative to traditional software development. Both professional developers and “citizen developers” (non-professional developers) can use a low-code platform to create apps of varying complexity to meet business demands for development, automate processes, and accelerate digital transformation." --[Creatio](https://www.creatio.com/page/low-code)

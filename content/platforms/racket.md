[Website](https://racket-lang.org/) | [Docs](https://docs.racket-lang.org/index.html)

General-purpose programming language, as well as ecosystem for language-oriented programming. Languages available (through the `#lang` directive):
* racket
* scribble/base
* typed/racket
* [datalog](datalog.html)
* racket/gui
* web-server/insta
* plait (plai language with a type system close to that of ML)
* profj (ProfessorJ: Java in Racket)
* racklog (Prolog-style logic programming)

Really broad ecosystem; deserves much more attention than it gets.

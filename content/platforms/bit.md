Looks like a visual builder using components very explicitly, complete with versioning support.

#### From the website:
Bit is a tool for composing modern applications from independent components. In Bit we build components not apps. In the workspace we only have components and the app is just another component. A component can be a composition of many other components that eventually compose an entire app. In Bit we never have a project, we never have an application, as having an application is against the nature of Component Driven Architecture.

Instead of building an application that consists of lots of components we build lots of components that compose to build many different applications. This is another way of thinking. The application is just a deployment therefore it has no meaning. It's just a composition of everything that is deployed to somewhere. Building with Bit helps you build more re-usable code.

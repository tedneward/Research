Windows might be the most used operating system for home users, but what if you don't want to use Microsoft's OS but do want to use the apps written to run on it? Before SteamOS and the Proton compatibility layer added that functionality to Linux, ReactOS was the only answer to that question. It's an open-source clone of Windows NT that is fully compatible with any app, driver, and service that also runs on Windows NT.

As such, it's probably the easiest retro-feeling OS to install and use because it feels familiar while offering modern conveniences and stability. It can also be run from a live USB, so you don't even have to install it on your internal hard drive if you prefer to test-drive things before proceeding.

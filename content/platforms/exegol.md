Exegol is the best solution to deploy powerful hacking environments securely, easily, professionally. No more unstable, not-so-security-focused systems lacking major offensive tools. Kali Linux (and similar alternatives) are great toolboxes for learners, students and junior pentesters. But professionals have different needs, and their context require a whole new design. Exegol fits pentesters, CTF players, bug bounty hunters, researchers, beginners and advanced users, defenders, from stylish macOS users and corporate Windows pros to UNIX-like power users.

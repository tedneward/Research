summary=Standardized web browser programming.
~~~~~~

The Web browsers ([Chrome](../chrome), [Safari](../safari), IE, [Firefox](../firefox), etc) form a platform in of themselves, given how much is targeted specifically to them. That said, there is a great deal of overlap between the browser ecosystem and the [NodeJS](../nodejs) platform, owing to the ECMAScript-based nature of each.

Other browsers:
* [Orion](https://browser.kagi.com/) (macOS, iOS/iPadOS)

## Web APIs
[MDN list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API):

* [Background tasks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Tasks_API): provides the ability to queue tasks to be executed automatically by the user agent when it determines that there is free time to do so.
* [Background Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Fetch_API)
* [Bluetooth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API)
* [Broadcast Channel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API): broadcast messages across windows/frames/etc
* [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API): a means for drawing 2D graphics via JavaScript and the HTML `<canvas>` element.
* [Channel Messaging API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Channel_Messaging_API): allows two separate scripts running in different browsing contexts attached to the same document (e.g., two IFrames, or the main document and an IFrame, two documents via a SharedWorker, or two workers) to communicate directly, passing messages between one another through two-way channels (or pipes) with a port at each end.
* [Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API): functionality to allow developers to perform debugging tasks, such as logging messages or the values of variables at set points in your code, or timing how long an operation takes to complete.
* [Credential Management API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Credential_Management_API): enables a website to create, store, and retrieve credentials. A credential is an item which enables a system to make an authentication decision: for example, to decide whether to sign a user into an account.
* [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)
* [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API): generalized replacement for XMLHttpRequest
* [Fullscreen](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API): adds methods to present a specific Element (and its descendants) in full-screen mode, and to exit full-screen mode once it is no longer needed.
* [Geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)
* [HTML Drag and Drop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)
* [IndexedDB](/storage/indexeddb.html)
* [Intersection Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API): provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport.
* [Navigation Timing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_timing_API): measure the performance of a web site.
* [Page Visibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API): determine whether a page is actually visible to the user
* [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API): gives web applications the ability to receive messages pushed to them from a server, whether or not the web app is in the foreground, or even currently loaded, on a user agent. This lets developers deliver asynchronous notifications and updates to users that opt in
* [Server Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events): It's possible for a server to send new data to a web page at any time, by pushing messages to the web page. These incoming messages can be treated as Events + data inside the web page.
* [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)
* [Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API)
* [Storage Access](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API)
* [Touch Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events)
* [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_API)
* [Web Notifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API)
* [Web Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)
* [Web Workers](../webworkers)
* [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) (This should be its own page)
* [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) (This should be its own page)
* [Websockets API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Websockets_API) and [here](/distribution/websockets.html)

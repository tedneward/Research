Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. Powered by a centralized software catalog, Backstage restores order to your microservices and infrastructure and enables your product teams to ship high-quality code quickly — without compromising autonomy.

Backstage unifies all your infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation to create a streamlined development environment from end to end.

Out of the box, Backstage includes:

* Backstage Software Catalog for managing all your software (microservices, libraries, data pipelines, websites, ML models, etc.)
* Backstage Software Templates for quickly spinning up new projects and standardizing your tooling with your organization’s best practices
* Backstage TechDocs for making it easy to create, maintain, find, and use technical documentation, using a "docs like code" approach
* Plus, a growing ecosystem of open source plugins that further expand Backstage’s customizability and functionality

Backstage was created by Spotify but is now hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as an Incubation level project.

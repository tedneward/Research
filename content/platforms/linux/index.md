Distributions ([DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/)):

Popular

* [AnduinOS](https://anduinos.com): looks just like Windows, built by a Microsoft engineer
* [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/): a custom Fedora Atomic image built with cloud native technology that brings the best of Linux gaming to all of your devices - including your favorite handheld.
* [CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/): performance-minded distribution ([Review](https://fossforce.com/2025/08/cachyos-distrowatchs-top-distro-has-speed-polish-and-features/))
* [CommodoreOS](https://www.commodoreos.net/): A Commodore-themed talking Linux desktop, complete with hundreds of games, makes for the biggest distro we've seen yet.
* [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
* [MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/): a family of operating systems (and a cooperative venture between the antiX and MX Linux communities) that are designed to combine elegant and efficient desktops with high stability and solid performance.
* [Omarchy Linux](https://omarchy.org/): Linux image used by 37signals developers ("a clone of DHH's desktop") -- "an opinionated Arch + Hyprland Setup by DHH"
* [Pop! OS](https://pop.system76.com/)
* [RefreshOS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/refreshos/): has been known historically for its user-friendliness, speed, and elegant design that focuses on stability and customization. ([Review](https://fossforce.com/2025/08/refreshos-2-5-smooth-stylish-and-almost-spotless-linux/))
* [Siduction](https://siduction.org/): an operating system based on the Linux kernel and the GNU project. In addition, there are applications and libraries from Debian. The name siduction is a play on two words. The word sid, which is the codename of Debian Unstable, and seduction in the sense of seduce.
* [SparkyLinux](https://sparkylinux.org/download/stable/): a GNU/Linux distribution based on the Debian GNU/Linux operating system.
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
* [VanillaOS](../vanillaos)
* [Zorin](https://zorin.com/os/)

Special-purpose

* [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/): Bleeding-edge distro of great complexity
* [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/): Ethical hacking
* [Nix OS](https://nixos.org/): Functional-programming principles brought to the OS level
* [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/): "When you hear the word virtualization, you’d probably think of a home server platform like Proxmox, XCP-ng, or Harvester. However, Qubes OS uses this neat technology in a different way. Rather than excelling in self-hosted projects, Qubes OS is designed to compartmentalize your apps inside isolated environments of varying access privileges to enhance the security of your system. Similar to virtual machines, these compartments, or qubes, are armed with their own templates, which are based on different operating systems. You also get to modify everything from the packages and binaries to the network interfaces and I/O devices for your qubes, making it amazing for security-conscious users. Unfortunately, the virtualization-heavy nature of Qubes OS makes it a bit hard to get accustomed to the distro. You’ll also have to contend with the performance issues of running multiple OS templates inside the same OS. That’s before you include the sheer pain of passing GPUs to the qubes."
* [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/): For Kubernetes lovers

Gaming

* [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/): a Linux distribution designed specifically for gaming -- and it's quickly become my favorite for this purpose. Part of what makes Bazzite so good for gaming is that it includes everything necessary to play Steam games right out of the box. Also, Bazzite includes support for HDR & VRR; uses the System76 CPU scheduler for improved gameplay; adds community-developed tools and tweaks to streamline the gaming and streaming experience; includes a proprietary driver for GeForce GUPs; adds Waydroid to run Linux games; and offers LUKs full-disk encryption and game controller support. Another key aspect of Bazzite is that it's a SteamOS clone. For those unfamiliar with SteamOS, the operating system powers the SteamDeck, so it's ideal for gaming on Linux. In fact, I'd have to say that Bazzite is the single best Linux distribution for gaming. However, remember that Bazzite isn't a 1:1 clone of SteamOS. The biggest difference is that Bazzite is based on Fedora, whereas SteamOS is based on Arch.
* [DraugerOS](https://draugeros.org/): based on Ubuntu and ships with tons of optimizations and modifications intended to improve gaming performance and the gaming experience. You'll find simple changes (such as a custom Plasma desktop) to far more complicated optimizations (such as a custom kernel with lot latency enabled and a scheduling frequency from 250Hz to 1000Hz). Everything in Drauger OS has been tweaked to make it an ideal gaming platform. In fact, the developers make no bones about the fact that Drauger OS is designed explicitly for gaming. This isn't your normal desktop OS. It's not aimed at productivity, shopping, socialization, project management, or development. Drauger OS supports several gaming platforms (such as Steam, Lutris, PlayOnLinux, etc.), works with several different game controllers, offers higher frame rates, and reduced screen tearing, as well as an overall increase in performance. The one downfall of Drauger OS is that the installation is a bit of a departure from the standard Ubuntu offering. The installation isn't hard, it's just… different. 
* [Ubuntu Game Pack](https://ualinux.com/en/ubuntu-gamepack): If you prefer a more traditional Ubuntu desktop but still want something geared toward gaming, Ubuntu Game Pack is a great option. This distribution supports multiple gaming platforms, offers a GameMode with several optimizations, and includes the usual Ubuntu user-friendliness and all the apps found in the standard repositories. Ubuntu Game Pack includes Steam, Lutris, Itch.io, and Game Jolt, as well as PlayOnLinux, CrossOver, Wine, DoxBox, ScummVM, and more. Some of those options are free, while others are pay-to-play or subscription-based. Although there are no pre-installed games, you'll find a wealth of options via the various services. Ubuntu Game Pack ships with a custom GNOME desktop environment. The real focal point of Ubuntu Game Pack is GameMode, which gives Ubuntu the necessary tweaks to make it a viable gaming solution. GameMod is a daemon/lib combination that allows for certain optimizations, such as CPU governor, I/O Priority, process niceness, kernel scheduler, screensaver inhibiting, GPU performance mode (for NVIDIA and AMD), GPU overclocking (NVIDIA), CPU core pinning or parking, and customized scripts.
* [Fedora Game Spin](https://fedoraproject.org/labs/games): If you'd like a gaming-specific spin on your favorite Fedora distribution, look no further than Fedora Game Spin. However, there is a catch in that it's only for open-source games. But the good news is that there are hundreds of available games. The bad news is that they tend to look and feel like cheap knock-offs of other games. You'll find games like Extreme Tux Racer, Wesnoth, Hedewars, Colossus, BZFlag, Freeciv, Warzon 2100, MegaGlest, and Fillets. There are games ranging from first-person shooters, real-time and turn-based strategy, and puzzle games. In the end, if you're looking for varied free games, Fedora Game Spin might be a great option. And when you combine that with Fedora's inherently great performance, this spin becomes even more appealing.
* [Regata OS](https://get.regataos.com.br/): Regata OS is about achieving as much performance as possible so your favorite games play as expected. Regata OS includes GameMode as well as AMD FSR (to help boost frame rates while delivering a high-resolution experience). If you have a laptop with hybrid graphics, Regata OS can run some applications with the dedicated GPU by default on AMD and NVIDIA-based laptops. Regata also supports Vulkan for faster performance and improved video quality. Moreover, you'll find support for Steam and Game Access, which allows you to run games from Origin, Battle.net, Ubisoft Connect, and the Epic Games Store. Unlike other gaming-specific distributions, Regata OS can also serve as a great desktop solution for productivity and other uses.

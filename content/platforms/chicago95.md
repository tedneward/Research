Want to experience what Windows 95 felt like without having to install your internet from a demo disc of Netscape Navigator? Well, you're in luck because Chicago95 is a deeply customized Linux theme that gives you all the 32-bit goodness of Win95 while saving you from the dial-up tones of a modem connection that always seemed louder at night. It's not a simple reskin either, with everything from the Start menu and taskbar faithfully recreated for you to use. There's even an automated installer that mimics the installers of Windows from that era. It is truly a work of mad passion by its developer, and it is worth checking out just for that.

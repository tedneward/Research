### Architecture / networking / backend

[Flutter Architectural Samples](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples): Brian Egan's implementations of TodoMVC using a variety of state management and architectural approaches. If you'd like to see how an app built with `flutter-redux` is different from one using BLoC, this is a great place to start.

[jsonexample](jsonexample) _(Flutter team)_: A simple app showing three different approaches to deserializing JSON: hand-written constructors, `json_serializable`, and `built_value`.

[provider_counter](provider_counter) _(Flutter team)_: The simplest possible app (the counter) using `provider` for state management. This was previously known as `scoped_model_counter`, and used `scoped_model` for state management.

[provider_shopper](provider_shopper) _(Flutter team)_: A slightly more complex example of state management with `provider`. This example demonstrates multiple `providers`, navigation between screens, and some other advanced topics.

### UI

[Veggie Seasons](veggieseasons) _(Flutter team)_ [Available on the App Store!](https://itunes.apple.com/is/app/veggie-seasons/id1450855435): Veggie Seasons is a published iOS app that displays seasonality, vitamin content, and trivia for a bunch of different fruits and veggies. If you're interested in learning how to use Flutter's [Cupertino](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/cupertino) package to build interfaces for iOS, it's a great place to start.

[Flutter UI Kit](https://github.com/iampawan/Flutter-UI-Kit): Another sample from Flutter GDE Pawan Kumar, this repo includes a variety of polished UI examples.

[FlutterPlayground](https://github.com/ibhavikmakwana/FlutterPlayground): A repo full of short, specific examples (with animated screenshots!) showing commonly used widgets and how to put them to work.

[Platform Design](platform_design) _(Flutter team)_: An app designed to look great on both iOS and Android, this sample shows how to add platform-specific design touches to an app while reusing as much code as possible.

[Animation examples](animations) _(Flutter team)_: A collection of animation examples. The app starts with basic concepts like `AnimationController` and `Tween`, then progresses to transitions and advanced demos.

### Maps

[Place tracker](place_tracker) _(Flutter team)_: A simple integration of the Google Maps plugin for Flutter, this app shows how to add a map to the Flutter widget hierarchy, create markers, and more.

[Flutter, maps, and Cloud Firestore](flutter_maps_firestore) _(Flutter team)_: This app shows the use of a Google map with data loaded from Cloud Firestore. It was [built live on stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpQLFAFqMlw) at Cloud Next '19.

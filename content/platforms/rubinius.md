From the Github Overview:
> Rubinius is a virtual computing machine. As a computing machine, it possesses several mechanisms that physical computers possess to support computation. It runs in an environment that provides various capabilities. These are presented to the machine through the Environment object. It has certain configuration values that influence how the machine operates. This is managed by the Configuration object. The machine has a boot process that carefully builds up the components in a precise order until the machine is ready to run user code. When the user code completes executing, the machine halts, again following a precise sequence of deconstructing the various components. The rest of the components of the machine are described below.

[Website](https://retool.com/) Commercial with a free tier.

All internal tools are made up of the building blocks: Tables, Lists, Charts, Forms, Wizards, Maps and so on. Retool provides a complete set of powerful building blocks out of the box. Spend your time getting UI in front of stakeholders, not hunting down the best React table library. Assemble your app in 30 seconds by dragging and dropping from our pre-built [components](https://retool.com/components).

Retool has 4 fundamental pieces to it:

* Connect your data sources, like PostgreSQL, Salesforce, Firebase, and 20+ more
* Build your queries and logic in SQL or Javascript
* Connect your queries and logic to prebuilt components like tables, text inputs, and buttons
* Organize and connect your components into an app

Retool isn't just a front end, though â€“ we take care of a lot of the pesky logic that internal tools tend to require, like scheduling queries, updating and writing data, and triggers. Retool apps are easy to share with your teammates and stakeholders, and we offer granular access management and audit logs to keep things secure.

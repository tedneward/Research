#### Personal conversation with @devhammer (7/1/2021):
Suports either a cloud (AWS)-based deployment model, or a "self-service" deployment model.

Considers itself very "low-code"--a tool that developers will recognize and find useful, but not for people with no programming background. "Brought back all the power/love of using VB, but keeps people in that visual model/mindset longer than VB does."

Uses Apache Cordova for multiplatform application client. Recently moved from ASP.NET WebForms-based UI to a React one. (Will continue to support WebForms for a "long time to come".)

Defined by the [JVMS 14](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se14/html/index.html) (or [PDF](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/jls14.pdf)).

### Virtual machine implementations
Numerous JVM virtual machine implementations available:
* [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/)  among others; see [foojay](https://foojay.io/) for interesting details on OpenJDK
* [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) is a drop-in replacement for Java, Node, Python, Ruby, and other VMs
* [Eclipse OpenJ9](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/)
* Oracle
* Zulu
* Amazon Coretto

[AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) builds JDK downloads of OpenJDK and OpenJ9 builds.

(Previous-to-Java8 versions are on the Oracle website; I don't know that anybody should care about versions prior to 8. Prior to Java6, the VM was essentially unchanged since Java2/JDK 1.2.)

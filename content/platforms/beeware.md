BeeWare is not a single product, or tool, or library - it’s a collection of tools and libraries, each of which works together to help you write cross platform Python applications with a native GUI. It includes:

* Toga, a cross platform widget toolkit;
* Briefcase, a tool for packaging Python projects as distributable artefacts that can be shipped to end users;
* Libraries (such as Rubicon ObjC) for accessing platform-native libraries;
* Pre-compiled builds of Python that can be used on platforms where official Python installers aren’t available.

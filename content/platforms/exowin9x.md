This pack includes 662 Windows 9x games. The focus of the main project is on games that were either released in English or are fairly easy to play without knowledge of their native language. While the focus is on English games, we have included other language releases as well as we have found them. Currently the focus is on games; however, entertainment applications and certain productivity apps will be considered for future releases as an add-on pack. The software included in eXoWin9x is already set up using DOSBox X, with a handful of games relying on 86Box. Virtual Hard Drives (VHDs) are used along with parent images of the Win9X OS. This allows the pack to run games in Windows without each game needing its own copy.

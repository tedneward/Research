The CLR platform. [VM Specifications](/vms/clr/specifications) | [Interoperability](clr/interoperability)

CLR/CLI Language lists: [CLI Languages - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLI_Languages) | [List of CLI languages - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages) | [.NET Powered](https://bitbucket.org/brianritchie/wiki/wiki/.NET%20Languages)

Source repositories for various parts of the CLR platform:

* [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang): mainstream OO language
* [F#](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp): object/functional hybrid language
* [WinForms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms): "legacy" (Win32-based) UI framework for Windows
* [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore): a server-side Web framework
* [WPF](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf): Windows Presentation Foundation
* [EFCore](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore): Entity Framework Core, an O/R-M
* [MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui): NET Multi-platform App UI, a framework for building native device applications spanning mobile, tablet, and desktop

There used to be multiple CLR implementations, but all have more or less fallen into disuse and disrepair. [.NET Core (CoreCLR)](../dotnetcore) and the Windows CLR are the only ones left standing, though Mono is technically still a "thing" with its incorporation as part of Microsoft it's hard to see how it will remain independent of the CoreCLR for long. See the [CoreCLR VM page](/vms/coreclr) for implementation details.

Named Pipe server:
```c#
using (var server = new NamedPipeServerStream("my_pipe_name"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Waiting for client connection...");
    server.WaitForConnection();
    Console.WriteLine("Client connected.");

    // Read and write data through the pipe
}
```

Client:
```c#
using (var client = new NamedPipeClientStream(".", "my_pipe_name", PipeDirection.InOut))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Connecting to server...");
    client.Connect();
    Console.WriteLine("Connected to server.");

    // Read and write data through the pipe
}

[Programmatically Convert HTML to PDF in .NET Core C# Without Dependencies](https://dev.to/grapecity/programmatically-convert-html-to-pdf-in-net-core-c-without-dependencies-76f): "... we will learn about the new GcHtml package, tips for migrating from the old to the new GcHtml package, and finally, explore how to use the new GcHtml package for converting HTML to PDF. GcHtml uses a Chrome or Edge browser (already installed in the current system or downloaded from a public website) in headless mode and interacts with it using the WebSocket protocol."

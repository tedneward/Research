[SSCLI Essentials 2.0 (Draft) PDF](../SSCLI2Internals-DRAFT.pdf): This is the last (draft) copy I have of the SSCLI Essentials 2.0 book that Joel Pobar and I worked on for Microsoft Research, as a follow-on to the first edition by David, Geoff, and myself. Most high-level details appear to be in sync with the .NET Core release, although as one might expect, there is some source drift--not unexpected, since this book was done in 2006.

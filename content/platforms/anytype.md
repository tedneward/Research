* Ships with several "apps" preinstalled: "Page", "Tasks", "Files", "Contacts", "Bookmarks", "Music"
* "You can change apps and create new ones without code"
* "Personal page: Design your personal page. Showcase any information you like. People can subscribe to it and get updates. A cool fact is that your subscribers become your servers--no need to pay for hosting. It's like a social network, but this you actually own."
* "Anytype works without a central server, so only you have access to your encryption keys and data. All apps run locally and exchange data directly in a peer-to-peer way without exposing it to intermediaries even when you work across devices and with others."
* "Anytype stores information locally, so you can use as much space as you have for free."
* "Anytype is built on [IPFS](../../distribution/ipfs) protocol--the new protocol to upgrade the Web."

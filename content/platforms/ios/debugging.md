* [Hopper + lldb for iOS Developers: A Gentle Introduction](https://github.com/bartcone/reverse-engineering-blog): Lately I've seen a lot of people asking "How are you getting that pseudo-code," in regards to @steipete's radar he filed and I thought this would be a great first blog post of mine as I've been wanting to for awhile. I spend a lot of my time in a tool called Hopper (it's a must have in my toolbox) and while it's an amazing tool, it can seem overwhelming at first. The goal of this post is to bridge the gap for those that have shied away or aren't familiar with reverse engineering.

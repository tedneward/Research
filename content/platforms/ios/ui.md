- [How SwiftUI can now be used to build entire iOS apps](https://wwdcbysundell.com/2020/building-entire-apps-with-swiftui/): This year, however, entire apps can now be defined directly using SwiftUI, thanks to a few new additions to its API.

- [What’s new in SwiftUI for iOS 14](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/221/whats-new-in-swiftui-for-ios-14): SwiftUI was inevitably going to see big changes this year, and I’m really excited to experiment with them all – text views, color pickers, progress views, and even limited support for grids have all landed. 

- [How to define SwiftUI properties](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof/status/1280433133813456896): Here's a first draft of a decision tree for how to define your SwiftUI properties...

- [A guide to SwiftUI’s state management system](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/swiftui-state-management-guide/): What separates SwiftUI from Apple’s previous UI frameworks isn’t just how views and other UI components are defined, but also how view-level state is managed throughout an app that uses it.

- [Mastering toolbars in SwiftUI](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2020/07/15/mastering-toolbars-in-swiftui/): This week we will learn all about the new Toolbar API.

## General

#### [Variable Width Strings](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/variable-width-strings/)

> Wouldn’t it be useful if you could automatically change the text based on the available space? There’s a little-known feature of the localization system that does precisely that.

#### [UIView styling with functions](https://felginep.github.io/2019-02-19/uiview-styling-with-functions)

> Today I want to talk about UIView styling. The common approach when we want to customize the display of native UI controls (for instance UIButton or UILabel) is to create a subclass that overrides a bunch of properties. That works well most of the time, but some problems may arise.

#### [Two Takes on Adaptive Cell Layout](https://blog.alltheflow.com/two-takes-on-adaptive-cell-layout/)

On autolayout, adaptive table cells, and using UIStackView (or not!)

#### [Popovers, UINavigationController, and preferredContentSize](https://noahgilmore.com/blog/popover-uinavigationcontroller-preferredcontentsize/)

> In this post we'll look at a very specific but tricky interaction in UIKit, one which took me multiple days to work out how to implement.

#### [Modality changes in iOS 13](https://sarunw.com/posts/modality-changes-in-ios13)

> One behavior that changed and might break your old app once you starting adopting new iOS 13 is the modal presentation.

#### [The Auto Layout Comprehendium™](http://mischa-hildebrand.de/en/2017/11/the-auto-layout-comprehendium/)

> The Auto Layout Comprehendium™ is intended as a compendium for you to look up certain topics and to fully understand the internal mechanics behind the technology. While following an intuitive approach, it will help you master Auto Layout at a deeper level and empower you to build adaptable layouts without conflicts or ambiguities.

#### [The iOS 13 Design Guidelines: An Illustrated Guide](https://learnui.design/blog/ios-design-guidelines-templates.html)

> In this article, we’re going to cover basically everything you need to know to design an iPhone app following standard iOS 13 conventions and style.

#### [SF Symbols Changes in iOS 14.2](https://hacknicity.medium.com/sf-symbols-changes-in-ios-14-2-8a8bdf708426)

> There are now three different sets of symbols to consider...

#### [Tweaking The iOS System Fonts](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/tweaking-the-ios-system-fonts/)

> Before you switch to a custom font don’t overlook how much you can tweak the appearance of the system fonts. A quick review of some font APIs that work for both UIKit and SwiftUI.

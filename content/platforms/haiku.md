BeOS used C++ as its "native" development language of choice (rather than C). As such, Be (and Haiku) are interesting in examining how we were thinking about OS-level integration using C++ at the time (late 90's, early 2000's). Might be interesting to run as a primary OS of choice for a few days, just to see where it's at, but it's probably not going to win any new converts over from macOS, Windows, or any of the modern Linux distros.

[Simplify](https://github.com/CalebFenton/simplify): Generic Android Deobfuscator: "Simplify virtually executes an app to understand its behavior and then tries to optimize the code so that it behaves identically but is easier for a human to understand. Each optimization type is simple and generic, so it doesn't matter what the specific type of obfuscation is used."

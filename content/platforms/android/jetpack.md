Material 3 includes updated theming and components and Material You personalization features like dynamic color, and is designed to be cohesive with the new Android 12 visual style and system UI.

* jetifier: A standalone tool that migrates a library's dependencies on the deprecated support library to equivalent AndroidX dependencies.
* leanback: Write apps for Android TV devices using dpad-friendly widgets and template fragments.
* legacy: This artifact and its classes are deprecated. Starting with Android 8, background check restrictions make this class no longer useful.
* loader: Load data for your UI that survives configuration changes.
* localbroadcastmanager: This artifact and its classes are deprecated. Use LiveData or reactive streams instead.

Fundamentals course covers:

1. Android Studio and HelloWorld
2. Layouts (LinearLayout, ConstraintLayout), event-handling, changing View properties, data binding to avoid findViewById()
3. Fragments, navigation graph, navigation drawer and options menu, modifying the destination of the Back button (back stack manipulation), firing an Intent to launch a new Activity
4. Activity and fragment lifecycles, lifecycle library
5. Architecture components: ViewModel, LiveData objects, wiring ViewModel to LiveData directly so as to avoid putting code in the activity event handlers
6. Room (O/R-M)
7. RecyclerView
8. Network access, Glide library
9. Repository concept, WorkManager (background tasks)
10. Design: themes and styles, material design, accessibility

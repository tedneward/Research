"GNUstep provides the foundations for a portable desktop environment, like offering the base Workspace API (implemented by the official GWorkspace, but user-replaceable) and a set of useful but not mandatory applications. The completion of a desktop environment is done by other projects like the The [GNUstep Application Project](http://www.nongnu.org/gap/) or [Etoile](http://www.etoile-project.org/)."

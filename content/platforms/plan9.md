title=Plan9
tags=platform, operating system, concurrency
summary=A distributed research operating system developed at Bell Labs by the same team that created Unix and C. Over the years there have been four major releases or ‘Editions’; after the Fourth Edition the project adopted a ‘open source’ model and changes are published daily in a public repository; a distributed computing environment assembled from separate machines acting as CPU servers, file servers, and terminals. The pieces are connected by a single file-oriented protocol and local name space operations.

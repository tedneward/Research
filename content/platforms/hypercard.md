HyperCard was probably the most powerful platform on the Mac that I never used, regretfully. (I was an entirely-PC/Windows kid at the time.)

## Open Source HyperCard

* [The xTalk interpreter archive](http://creysoft.com/xtalk/) - Lots of HyperTalk-like programming languages, with source code
* [OpenXION](https://github.com/kreativekorp/openxion) - A cross-platform HyperTalk-like programming language written in Java, with source code.
* [HCX](https://github.com/pgostation/HCX) - Mac OS X source code for reading HyperCard stacks.
* [stackimport](http://github.com/uliwitness/stackimport/) - A command-line tool that exports HyperCard stacks into image files and XML suitable for import into other applications.
* [CinsImp](http://joshuahawcroft.com/software/cinsimp/) - A HyperCard clone that runs on the web. This is a port of a previous Mac desktop application of the same name, for which Source code is available.
* [HyperCardPreview](https://github.com/PierreLorenzi/HyperCardPreview) - An application written in Swift that tries to faithfully render HyperCard stacks on OS X, bitmap fonts and all.
* [Stacksmith](http://stacksmith.com/) - An open source HyperCard clone-in-development of which you can already try occasional builds.
* [HyperCard File Format](https://hypercard.org/hypercard_file_format/) - A description of the general structure of a HyperCard stack on disk.
* [Pierre's HyperCard File Format](https://hypercard.org/hypercard_file_format_pierre/) - A modified version of the HyperCard File Format description above that contains additional information. Contributed by Pierre Lorenzi.
* [AddColor Resource Format](https://hypercard.org/addcolor_resource_format/) - A description of the general structure of the resources used by HyperCard 2.3 and later to store color information.
* [ColdCoffee HyperTalk to Java converter](https://hypercard.org/ColdCoffee.zip) - A bunch of Java source code files that read a subset of HyperTalk and create Java source code from that.
* [XFromApp XCMD engine](https://github.com/uliwitness/XFromApp) - Old C/C++ source code for running HyperCard plugins (XCMDs and XFCNs). Mostly of historical interest.
* [HyperTalk 1.x BNF grammar](http://www.jaedworks.com/hypercard/scripts/hypertalk-bnf.html) - A grammar for the HyperTalk programming langiage.

## Commercial HyperCard clones

* [SuperCard](http://supercard.us/) - The first HyperCard clone. For Mac OS X.
* [LiveCode](http://livecode.com/) - Originally known as MetaCard, this cross-platform IDE runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, iOS and as a browser plugin.
* [NovoCard](http://plectrum.com/novocard/) - A simple HyperCard-like app for the iPad, with JavaScript as the programming language.
* [BayCard](http://www.bayhoff.com/) - A modern HyperCard-like system for the Mac with Button Tasks/ClickScript-style programming.

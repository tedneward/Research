* [Top 7 SLMs You Can Run in the Browser](https://medium.com/@hadiyolworld007/top-7-slms-you-can-run-in-the-browser-fa67d921e669): 

    1. Llama 3.2 1B Instruct (Meta): A tiny Llama that actually chats. Great as a default “it just works” browser model; widely packaged for WebLLM. If you want the Meta feel without the Meta footprint, start here. Best for: lightweight assistants, UI copilots, form-fill helpers.
    2. Phi-3.5 Mini (Microsoft): Phi keeps surprising. The 3/3.5 “mini” variants punch above their size and appear in ready-to-use MLC builds (multiple quantizations). A strong default for reasoning-heavy prompts under tight budgets. Best for: structured responses, JSON mode, quick reasoning.
    3. Qwen 2.5 1.5B Instruct (Alibaba): Lean, multilingual, and chatty. The 1.5B Instruct variant is small enough for browsers yet capable enough for everyday tasks; plenty of WebLLM demos use it with WebGPU.

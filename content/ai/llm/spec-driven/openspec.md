Our philosophy:

```
→ fluid not rigid
→ iterative not waterfall
→ easy not complex
→ built for brownfield not just greenfield
→ scalable from personal projects to enterprises
```

## Quick Start

**Requires Node.js 20.19.0 or higher.**

Install OpenSpec globally:

npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest

Then navigate to your project directory and initialize:

cd your-project
openspec init

Now tell your AI: `/opsx:propose <what-you-want-to-build>`

If you want the expanded workflow (`/opsx:new`, `/opsx:continue`, `/opsx:ff`, `/opsx:verify`, `/opsx:sync`, `/opsx:bulk-archive`, `/opsx:onboard`), select it with `openspec config profile` and apply with `openspec update`.

# Getting Started

## How It Works

OpenSpec helps you and your AI coding assistant agree on what to build before any code is written.

**Default quick path (core profile):**

```text
/opsx:propose ──► /opsx:apply ──► /opsx:archive
```

**Expanded path (custom workflow selection):**

```text
/opsx:new ──► /opsx:ff or /opsx:continue ──► /opsx:apply ──► /opsx:verify ──► /opsx:archive
```

The default global profile is `core`, which includes `propose`, `explore`, `apply`, and `archive`. You can enable the expanded workflow commands with `openspec config profile` and then `openspec update`.

## What OpenSpec Creates

After running `openspec init`, your project has this structure:

```
openspec/
├── specs/              # Source of truth (your system's behavior)
│   └── <domain>/
│       └── spec.md
├── changes/            # Proposed updates (one folder per change)
│   └── <change-name>/
│       ├── proposal.md
│       ├── design.md
│       ├── tasks.md
│       └── specs/      # Delta specs (what's changing)
│           └── <domain>/
│               └── spec.md
└── config.yaml         # Project configuration (optional)
```

**Two key directories:**

- **`specs/`** - The source of truth. These specs describe how your system currently behaves. Organized by domain (e.g., `specs/auth/`, `specs/payments/`).

- **`changes/`** - Proposed modifications. Each change gets its own folder with all related artifacts. When a change is complete, its specs merge into the main `specs/` directory.

## Understanding Artifacts

Each change folder contains artifacts that guide the work:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `proposal.md` | The "why" and "what" - captures intent, scope, and approach |
| `specs/` | Delta specs showing ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED requirements |
| `design.md` | The "how" - technical approach and architecture decisions |
| `tasks.md` | Implementation checklist with checkboxes |

**Artifacts build on each other:**

```
proposal ──► specs ──► design ──► tasks ──► implement
   ▲           ▲          ▲                    │
   └───────────┴──────────┴────────────────────┘
            update as you learn
```

You can always go back and refine earlier artifacts as you learn more during implementation.

## How Delta Specs Work

Delta specs are the key concept in OpenSpec. They show what's changing relative to your current specs.

### The Format

Delta specs use sections to indicate the type of change:

```markdown
# Delta for Auth

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Two-Factor Authentication
The system MUST require a second factor during login.

#### Scenario: OTP required
- GIVEN a user with 2FA enabled
- WHEN the user submits valid credentials
- THEN an OTP challenge is presented

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Session Timeout
The system SHALL expire sessions after 30 minutes of inactivity.
(Previously: 60 minutes)

#### Scenario: Idle timeout
- GIVEN an authenticated session
- WHEN 30 minutes pass without activity
- THEN the session is invalidated

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Remember Me
(Deprecated in favor of 2FA)
```

### What Happens on Archive

When you archive a change:

1. **ADDED** requirements are appended to the main spec
2. **MODIFIED** requirements replace the existing version
3. **REMOVED** requirements are deleted from the main spec

The change folder moves to `openspec/changes/archive/` for audit history.

## Example: Your First Change

Let's walk through adding dark mode to an application.

### 1. Start the Change (Default)

```text
You: /opsx:propose add-dark-mode

AI:  Created openspec/changes/add-dark-mode/
     ✓ proposal.md — why we're doing this, what's changing
     ✓ specs/       — requirements and scenarios
     ✓ design.md    — technical approach
     ✓ tasks.md     — implementation checklist
     Ready for implementation!
```

If you've enabled the expanded workflow profile, you can also do this as two steps: `/opsx:new` then `/opsx:ff` (or `/opsx:continue` incrementally).

### 2. What Gets Created

**proposal.md** - Captures the intent:

```markdown
# Proposal: Add Dark Mode

## Intent
Users have requested a dark mode option to reduce eye strain
during nighttime usage.

## Scope
- Add theme toggle in settings
- Support system preference detection
- Persist preference in localStorage

## Approach
Use CSS custom properties for theming with a React context
for state management.
```

**specs/ui/spec.md** - Delta showing new requirements:

```markdown
# Delta for UI

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Theme Selection
The system SHALL allow users to choose between light and dark themes.

#### Scenario: Manual toggle
- GIVEN a user on any page
- WHEN the user clicks the theme toggle
- THEN the theme switches immediately
- AND the preference persists across sessions

#### Scenario: System preference
- GIVEN a user with no saved preference
- WHEN the application loads
- THEN the system's preferred color scheme is used
```

**tasks.md** - Implementation checklist:

```markdown
# Tasks

## 1. Theme Infrastructure
- [ ] 1.1 Create ThemeContext with light/dark state
- [ ] 1.2 Add CSS custom properties for colors
- [ ] 1.3 Implement localStorage persistence

## 2. UI Components
- [ ] 2.1 Create ThemeToggle component
- [ ] 2.2 Add toggle to settings page
- [ ] 2.3 Update Header to include quick toggle

## 3. Styling
- [ ] 3.1 Define dark theme color palette
- [ ] 3.2 Update components to use CSS variables
```

### 3. Implement

```
You: /opsx:apply

AI:  Working through tasks...
     ✓ 1.1 Created ThemeContext with light/dark state
     ✓ 1.2 Added CSS custom properties to globals.css
     ✓ 1.3 Implemented localStorage persistence
     ✓ 2.1 Created ThemeToggle component
     ...
     All tasks complete!
```

During implementation, if you discover the design needs adjustment, just update the artifact and continue.

### 4. Archive

```
You: /opsx:archive

AI:  Archiving add-dark-mode...
     ✓ Merged specs into openspec/specs/ui/spec.md
     ✓ Moved to openspec/changes/archive/2025-01-24-add-dark-mode/
     Done! Ready for the next feature.
```

Your delta specs are now part of the main specs, documenting how your system works.

## Verifying and Reviewing

Use the CLI to check on your changes:

```bash
# List active changes
openspec list

# View change details
openspec show add-dark-mode

# Validate spec formatting
openspec validate add-dark-mode

# Interactive dashboard
openspec view
```

---

# OPSX Workflow

## What Is It?

It's a **fluid, iterative workflow** for OpenSpec changes. No more rigid phases — just actions you can take anytime.

## Why This Exists

The legacy OpenSpec workflow works, but it's **locked down**:

- **Instructions are hardcoded** — buried in TypeScript, you can't change them
- **All-or-nothing** — one big command creates everything, can't test individual pieces
- **Fixed structure** — same workflow for everyone, no customization
- **Black box** — when AI output is bad, you can't tweak the prompts

**OPSX opens it up.** Now anyone can:

1. **Experiment with instructions** — edit a template, see if the AI does better
2. **Test granularly** — validate each artifact's instructions independently
3. **Customize workflows** — define your own artifacts and dependencies
4. **Iterate quickly** — change a template, test immediately, no rebuild

```
Legacy workflow:                      OPSX:
┌────────────────────────┐           ┌────────────────────────┐
│  Hardcoded in package  │           │  schema.yaml           │◄── You edit this
│  (can't change)        │           │  templates/*.md        │◄── Or this
│        ↓               │           │        ↓               │
│  Wait for new release  │           │  Instant effect        │
│        ↓               │           │        ↓               │
│  Hope it's better      │           │  Test it yourself      │
└────────────────────────┘           └────────────────────────┘
```

**This is for everyone:**
- **Teams** — create workflows that match how you actually work
- **Power users** — tweak prompts to get better AI outputs for your codebase
- **OpenSpec contributors** — experiment with new approaches without releases

We're all still learning what works best. OPSX lets us learn together.

## The User Experience

**The problem with linear workflows:**
You're "in planning phase", then "in implementation phase", then "done". But real work doesn't work that way. You implement something, realize your design was wrong, need to update specs, continue implementing. Linear phases fight against how work actually happens.

**OPSX approach:**
- **Actions, not phases** — create, implement, update, archive — do any of them anytime
- **Dependencies are enablers** — they show what's possible, not what's required next

```
  proposal ──→ specs ──→ design ──→ tasks ──→ implement
```

## Setup

```bash
# Make sure you have openspec installed — skills are automatically generated
openspec init
```

This creates skills in `.claude/skills/` (or equivalent) that AI coding assistants auto-detect.

By default, OpenSpec uses the `core` workflow profile (`propose`, `explore`, `apply`, `archive`). If you want the expanded workflow commands (`new`, `continue`, `ff`, `verify`, `sync`, `bulk-archive`, `onboard`), configure them with `openspec config profile` and apply with `openspec update`.

During setup, you'll be prompted to create a **project config** (`openspec/config.yaml`). This is optional but recommended.

## Project Configuration

Project config lets you set defaults and inject project-specific context into all artifacts.

### Creating Config

Config is created during `openspec init`, or manually:

```yaml
# openspec/config.yaml
schema: spec-driven

context: |
  Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Node.js
  API conventions: RESTful, JSON responses
  Testing: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for e2e
  Style: ESLint with Prettier, strict TypeScript

rules:
  proposal:
    - Include rollback plan
    - Identify affected teams
  specs:
    - Use Given/When/Then format for scenarios
  design:
    - Include sequence diagrams for complex flows
```

### Config Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `schema` | string | Default schema for new changes (e.g., `spec-driven`) |
| `context` | string | Project context injected into all artifact instructions |
| `rules` | object | Per-artifact rules, keyed by artifact ID |

### How It Works

**Schema precedence** (highest to lowest):
1. CLI flag (`--schema <name>`)
2. Change metadata (`.openspec.yaml` in change directory)
3. Project config (`openspec/config.yaml`)
4. Default (`spec-driven`)

**Context injection:**
- Context is prepended to every artifact's instructions
- Wrapped in `<context>...</context>` tags
- Helps AI understand your project's conventions

**Rules injection:**
- Rules are only injected for matching artifacts
- Wrapped in `<rules>...</rules>` tags
- Appear after context, before the template

### Artifact IDs by Schema

**spec-driven** (default):
- `proposal` — Change proposal
- `specs` — Specifications
- `design` — Technical design
- `tasks` — Implementation tasks

### Config Validation

- Unknown artifact IDs in `rules` generate warnings
- Schema names are validated against available schemas
- Context has a 50KB size limit
- Invalid YAML is reported with line numbers

### Troubleshooting

**"Unknown artifact ID in rules: X"**
- Check artifact IDs match your schema (see list above)
- Run `openspec schemas --json` to see artifact IDs for each schema

**Config not being applied:**
- Ensure file is at `openspec/config.yaml` (not `.yml`)
- Check YAML syntax with a validator
- Config changes take effect immediately (no restart needed)

**Context too large:**
- Context is limited to 50KB
- Summarize or link to external docs instead

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/opsx:propose` | Create a change and generate planning artifacts in one step (default quick path) |
| `/opsx:explore` | Think through ideas, investigate problems, clarify requirements |
| `/opsx:new` | Start a new change scaffold (expanded workflow) |
| `/opsx:continue` | Create the next artifact (expanded workflow) |
| `/opsx:ff` | Fast-forward planning artifacts (expanded workflow) |
| `/opsx:apply` | Implement tasks, updating artifacts as needed |
| `/opsx:verify` | Validate implementation against artifacts (expanded workflow) |
| `/opsx:sync` | Sync delta specs to main (expanded workflow, optional) |
| `/opsx:archive` | Archive when done |
| `/opsx:bulk-archive` | Archive multiple completed changes (expanded workflow) |
| `/opsx:onboard` | Guided walkthrough of an end-to-end change (expanded workflow) |

## Usage

### Explore an idea
```
/opsx:explore
```
Think through ideas, investigate problems, compare options. No structure required - just a thinking partner. When insights crystallize, transition to `/opsx:propose` (default) or `/opsx:new`/`/opsx:ff` (expanded).

### Start a new change
```
/opsx:propose
```
Creates the change and generates planning artifacts needed before implementation.

If you've enabled expanded workflows, you can instead use:

```text
/opsx:new        # scaffold only
/opsx:continue   # create one artifact at a time
/opsx:ff         # create all planning artifacts at once
```

### Create artifacts
```
/opsx:continue
```
Shows what's ready to create based on dependencies, then creates one artifact. Use repeatedly to build up your change incrementally.

```
/opsx:ff add-dark-mode
```
Creates all planning artifacts at once. Use when you have a clear picture of what you're building.

### Implement (the fluid part)
```
/opsx:apply
```
Works through tasks, checking them off as you go. If you're juggling multiple changes, you can run `/opsx:apply <name>`; otherwise it should infer from the conversation and prompt you to choose if it can't tell.

### Finish up
```
/opsx:archive   # Move to archive when done (prompts to sync specs if needed)
```

## When to Update vs. Start Fresh

You can always edit your proposal or specs before implementation. But when does refining become "this is different work"?

### What a Proposal Captures

A proposal defines three things:
1. **Intent** — What problem are you solving?
2. **Scope** — What's in/out of bounds?
3. **Approach** — How will you solve it?

The question is: which changed, and by how much?

### Update the Existing Change When:

**Same intent, refined execution**
- You discover edge cases you didn't consider
- The approach needs tweaking but the goal is unchanged
- Implementation reveals the design was slightly off

**Scope narrows**
- You realize full scope is too big, want to ship MVP first
- "Add dark mode" → "Add dark mode toggle (system preference in v2)"

**Learning-driven corrections**
- Codebase isn't structured how you thought
- A dependency doesn't work as expected
- "Use CSS variables" → "Use Tailwind's dark: prefix instead"

### Start a New Change When:

**Intent fundamentally changed**
- The problem itself is different now
- "Add dark mode" → "Add comprehensive theme system with custom colors, fonts, spacing"

**Scope exploded**
- Change grew so much it's essentially different work
- Original proposal would be unrecognizable after updates
- "Fix login bug" → "Rewrite auth system"

**Original is completable**
- The original change can be marked "done"
- New work stands alone, not a refinement
- Complete "Add dark mode MVP" → Archive → New change "Enhance dark mode"

### The Heuristics

```

                    │                  │                  │
          ┌────────┴────────┐  ┌──────┴──────┐   ┌───────┴───────┐
          │                 │  │             │   │               │
         YES               NO YES           NO  NO              YES
          │                 │  │             │   │               │
          ▼                 ▼  ▼             ▼   ▼               ▼
       UPDATE            NEW  UPDATE       NEW  UPDATE          NEW
```

| Test | Update | New Change |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Identity** | "Same thing, refined" | "Different work" |
| **Scope overlap** | >50% overlaps | <50% overlaps |
| **Completion** | Can't be "done" without changes | Can finish original, new work stands alone |
| **Story** | Update chain tells coherent story | Patches would confuse more than clarify |

### The Principle

> **Update preserves context. New change provides clarity.**
>
> Choose update when the history of your thinking is valuable.
> Choose new when starting fresh would be clearer than patching.

Think of it like git branches:
- Keep committing while working on the same feature
- Start a new branch when it's genuinely new work
- Sometimes merge a partial feature and start fresh for phase 2

## What's Different?

| | Legacy (`/openspec:proposal`) | OPSX (`/opsx:*`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | One big proposal document | Discrete artifacts with dependencies |
| **Workflow** | Linear phases: plan → implement → archive | Fluid actions — do anything anytime |
| **Iteration** | Awkward to go back | Update artifacts as you learn |
| **Customization** | Fixed structure | Schema-driven (define your own artifacts) |

**The key insight:** work isn't linear. OPSX stops pretending it is.

## Architecture Deep Dive

This section explains how OPSX works under the hood and how it compares to the legacy workflow.
Examples in this section use the expanded command set (`new`, `continue`, etc.); default `core` users can map the same flow to `propose → apply → archive`.

### Component Architecture

**Legacy workflow** uses hardcoded templates in TypeScript:

```

### Dependency Graph Model

Artifacts form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Dependencies are **enablers**, not gates:

```
                              proposal
                             (root node)
                                  │
                    ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
                    │                           │
                    ▼                           ▼
                 specs                       design
              (requires:                  (requires:
               proposal)                   proposal)
                    │                           │
                    └─────────────┬─────────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                               tasks
                           (requires:
                           specs, design)
                                  │
                                  ▼
                          ┌──────────────┐
                          │ APPLY PHASE  │
                          │ (requires:   │
                          │  tasks)      │
                          └──────────────┘
```

**State transitions:**

```
   BLOCKED ────────────────► READY ────────────────► DONE
      │                        │                       │
   Missing                  All deps               File exists
   dependencies             are DONE               on filesystem
```

### Information Flow

**Legacy workflow** — agent receives static instructions:

```
  User: "/openspec:proposal"
           │
           ▼
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Static instructions:                   │
  │  • Create proposal.md                   │
  │  • Create tasks.md                      │
  │  • Create design.md                     │
  │  • Create specs/<capability>/spec.md    │
  │                                         │
  │  No awareness of what exists or         │
  │  dependencies between artifacts         │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
           │
           ▼
  Agent creates ALL artifacts in one go
```

**OPSX** — agent queries for rich context:

```
  User: "/opsx:continue"
           │
           ▼
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Step 1: Query current state                                             │

  │  │  {                                                                 │  │

  │  │    ]                                                               │  │
  │  │  }                                                                 │  │

  │  │  {                                                                 │  │

  │  │  }                                                                 │  │
  │  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │

  │  Step 3: Read dependencies → Create ONE artifact → Show what's unlocked  │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Iteration Model

**Legacy workflow** — awkward to iterate:

```
  ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐
  │/proposal│ ──► │ /apply  │ ──► │/archive │
  └─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘
       │               │
       │               ├── "Wait, the design is wrong"
       │               │
       │               ├── Options:
       │               │   • Edit files manually (breaks context)
       │               │   • Abandon and start over
       │               │   • Push through and fix later
       │               │
       │               └── No official "go back" mechanism
       │
       └── Creates ALL artifacts at once
```

**OPSX** — natural iteration:

```
  /opsx:new ───► /opsx:continue ───► /opsx:apply ───► /opsx:archive
      │                │                  │
      │                │                  ├── "The design is wrong"
      │                │                  │
      │                │                  ▼
      │                │            Just edit design.md
      │                │            and continue!
      │                │                  │
      │                │                  ▼
      │                │         /opsx:apply picks up
      │                │         where you left off
      │                │
      │                └── Creates ONE artifact, shows what's unlocked
      │
      └── Scaffolds change, waits for direction
```

### Custom Schemas

Create custom workflows using the schema management commands:

```bash
# Create a new schema from scratch (interactive)
openspec schema init my-workflow

# Or fork an existing schema as a starting point
openspec schema fork spec-driven my-workflow

# Validate your schema structure
openspec schema validate my-workflow

# See where a schema resolves from (useful for debugging)
openspec schema which my-workflow
```

Schemas are stored in `openspec/schemas/` (project-local, version controlled) or `~/.local/share/openspec/schemas/` (user global).

**Schema structure:**
```
openspec/schemas/research-first/
├── schema.yaml
└── templates/
    ├── research.md
    ├── proposal.md
    └── tasks.md
```

**Example schema.yaml:**
```yaml
name: research-first
artifacts:
  - id: research        # Added before proposal
    generates: research.md
    requires: []

  - id: proposal
    generates: proposal.md
    requires: [research]  # Now depends on research

  - id: tasks
    generates: tasks.md
    requires: [proposal]
```

**Dependency Graph:**
```
   research ──► proposal ──► tasks
```

### Summary

| Aspect | Legacy | OPSX |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Templates** | Hardcoded TypeScript | External YAML + Markdown |
| **Dependencies** | None (all at once) | DAG with topological sort |
| **State** | Phase-based mental model | Filesystem existence |
| **Customization** | Edit source, rebuild | Create schema.yaml |
| **Iteration** | Phase-locked | Fluid, edit anything |
| **Editor Support** | Tool-specific configurator/adapters | Single skills directory |

## Schemas

Schemas define what artifacts exist and their dependencies. Currently available:

- **spec-driven** (default): proposal → specs → design → tasks

```bash
# List available schemas
openspec schemas

# See all schemas with their resolution sources
openspec schema which --all

# Create a new schema interactively
openspec schema init my-workflow

# Fork an existing schema for customization
openspec schema fork spec-driven my-workflow

# Validate schema structure before use
openspec schema validate my-workflow
```

## Tips

- Use `/opsx:explore` to think through an idea before committing to a change
- `/opsx:ff` when you know what you want, `/opsx:continue` when exploring
- During `/opsx:apply`, if something's wrong — fix the artifact, then continue
- Tasks track progress via checkboxes in `tasks.md`
- Check status anytime: `openspec status --change "name"`

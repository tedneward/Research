## Getting Started
**ADL (Agent Definition Language)** is an open, declarative, vendor-neutral specification for defining AI agents in a consistent, auditable, and interoperable way. It provides a shared language for describing:

- an agent’s identity and purpose  
- its tools and capabilities  
- its LLM configuration  
- its access to knowledge (RAG)  
- its permissions and sandbox  
- its dependencies  
- its governance metadata  

If **OpenAPI defines APIs**, **ADL defines agents**.

---

## 🧠 Why ADL Exists

Enterprises adopting AI agents face several systemic challenges:

- Each vendor defines “agents” differently  
- Tool contracts are inconsistent  
- RAG pipelines are wired differently across apps  
- Permissions are rarely explicit  
- Governance teams have no centralized visibility  
- Agents are not portable across platforms  
- Vendor lock-in slows enterprise adoption  
- Compliance and auditability are fragile or impossible  

**ADL solves these problems** by introducing a single, declarative, versioned artifact that describes what an agent *is* and what it is *allowed* to do.

---

## 🧩 What ADL *Is*

ADL defines:

- **Identity** — name, description, role, owner, version  
- **LLM Settings** — provider, model, temperature, max tokens  
- **Tools & Actions** — typed parameters, descriptions, return schemas  
- **RAG Inputs** — indices, types, metadata, paths  
- **Permissions** — file I/O, network, env vars  
- **Dependencies** — Python packages with optional version pins  
- **Governance** — created_by, approved_by, timestamps, version notes  

This makes agents:

- portable  
- predictable  
- auditable  
- reproducible  
- interoperable across vendors  

---

## 🚫 What ADL *Is Not*

To avoid confusion, ADL explicitly does **not** define:

- ❌ A2A (agent-to-agent) communication protocols  
- ❌ runtime tool invocation semantics (e.g., MCP)  
- ❌ prompt templating or formatting  
- ❌ workflow orchestration (Airflow, Temporal, Dagster)  
- ❌ API schemas (OpenAPI already solves that)  
- ❌ message transport (HTTP, gRPC, JSON-RPC)  

**ADL is laser-focused on definition — not execution.**

---

## 🔍 ADL vs AI App Definition  
**ADL is an Agent Definition Language - not a general AI App definition format.**

AI apps are broad and may include UI, API layers, deployments, data stores, or business logic.

Agents are specific:

- they reason  
- they call tools  
- they retrieve knowledge  
- they act autonomously  
- they require permission boundaries  

ADL models **agent competencies**, not app-level infrastructure.

This is a key strategic distinction.

## 🔄 Comparing ADL to Other Standards

### **ADL vs A2A**
- **A2A**: defines how agents communicate  
- **ADL**: defines *what* an agent is  

### **ADL vs MCP**
- **MCP**: runtime tool protocol  
- **ADL**: declarative definition of tools and capabilities  

### **ADL vs OpenAPI**
- **OpenAPI**: describes HTTP services  
- **ADL**: describes agent behavior, boundaries, and capabilities  

### **ADL vs Workflow Engines**
- Workflows = *when & how tasks execute*  
- ADL = *which agent executes them*

## 🌐 Why Next Moca Open Sourced ADL

Next Moca open-sourced ADL under **Apache 2.0** to enable:

### ✔ Ecosystem-wide interoperability  
### ✔ Enterprise trust and transparency  
### ✔ Neutral governance  
### ✔ Community-driven evolution  
### ✔ Vendor adoption without lock-in  
### ✔ Safe, compliant, standards-based agent deployment  

Open sourcing ensures ADL becomes a **true standard**, not a proprietary configuration format.

        {
          "name": "prompt",
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Image prompt",
          "required": true
        }
      ],

## Model instances

### [MiniMax M2.1](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.1)

An agent-focused LLM that brings top-tier autonomous capabilities into production. With 230B parameters (10B active), 60 tokens/sec output speed, and a 204,800-token context window, MiniMax-M2.1 represents a reliable choice for agentic coding and automation tasks.

Beyond the model itself, MiniMax also introduced [VIBE (Visual & Interactive Benchmark for Execution in Application Development)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MiniMaxAI/VIBE), a benchmark that evaluates a model’s ability to build complete, functional applications “from zero to one.” VIBE covers five core areas (Web, Simulation, Android, iOS, and Backend) and MiniMax-M2.1 delivers strong results overall, with particularly high scores on VIBE-Web (91.5) and VIBE-Android (89.7).

Why should you use MiniMax-M2.1:

-   **Exceptional multi-language programming**. MiniMax-M2.1 is tuned beyond Python, with systematic upgrades across languages like Rust, Java, Go, C++, Kotlin, Objective-C, TypeScript, and JavaScript. This means you can use it for real-world codebases that span multiple stacks. It also shows stable performance across popular coding-agent frameworks such as Claude Code, Cline, and Kilo Code.
-   **Web + mobile app development with better vibe coding**. It improves both execution and aesthetics for Web/AppDev, including stronger native Android and iOS capability and better design comprehension for interactive apps.
-   **More reliable agent behavior**. MiniMax-M2.1 strengthens interleaved thinking and focuses on executing composite instruction constraints. Simply put, it can follow multiple simultaneous rules such as system prompts, tool schemas, memory files, and specifications (e.g., `Agents.md` and `Claude.md`). This is exactly where many agent systems break down in real office and enterprise workflows.

Note that MiniMax-M2.1 is released under a modified MIT license. The only restriction is that if you use the model (or derivative works) in your commercial product, you must explicitly display the name “MiniMax M2.1” in the user interface.

GLM-ASR-Nano-2512 is a robust, open-source speech recognition model with 1.5B parameters. Designed for real-world complexity, it outperforms OpenAI Whisper V3 on multiple benchmarks while maintaining a compact size.

Key capabilities include:

* Exceptional Dialect Support Beyond standard Mandarin and English, the model is highly optimized for Cantonese (粤语) and other dialects, effectively bridging the gap in dialectal speech recognition.

* Low-Volume Speech Robustness Specifically trained for "Whisper/Quiet Speech" scenarios. It captures and accurately transcribes extremely low-volume audio that traditional models often miss.

* SOTA Performance Achieves the lowest average error rate (4.10) among comparable open-source models, showing significant advantages in Chinese benchmarks (Wenet Meeting, Aishell-1, etc..).

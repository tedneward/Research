What Quint Does:

1. Makes You and AI Think Structurally
Instead of jumping to conclusions and solutions, your AI generates competing hypotheses, checks them logically, tests against evidence, then you decide. Everything is in your plain sight.

2. Preserves Every Decision And Related Evidence
No more archaeology in chat history. Decisions live in .quint/ — queryable, auditable, yours.

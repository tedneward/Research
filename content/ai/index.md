## Large Language Models

* [Python Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction): LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:
    * Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
    * Reason: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

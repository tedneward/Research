## Large Language Models (LLMs)

* [Getting Started with LangChain: A Beginner’s Guide to Building LLM-Powered Applications](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-langchain-a-beginners-guide-to-building-llm-powered-applications-95fc8898732c)
* [Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance): "Guidance is an efficient programming paradigm for steering language models. With Guidance, you can control how output is structured and get high-quality output for your use case—while reducing latency and cost vs. conventional prompting or fine-tuning. It allows users to constrain generation (e.g. with regex and CFGs) as well as to interleave control (conditionals, loops, tool use) and generation seamlessly."
* [How to run a local LLM via LocalAI, an Open Source project](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-run-a-local-llm-via-localai-an-open-source-project/)
* [Python Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction): LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:
    * Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
    * Reason: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

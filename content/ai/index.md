## Large Language Models (LLMs)

* [Getting Started with LangChain: A Beginner’s Guide to Building LLM-Powered Applications](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-langchain-a-beginners-guide-to-building-llm-powered-applications-95fc8898732c)
* [Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance): "Guidance is an efficient programming paradigm for steering language models. With Guidance, you can control how output is structured and get high-quality output for your use case—while reducing latency and cost vs. conventional prompting or fine-tuning. It allows users to constrain generation (e.g. with regex and CFGs) as well as to interleave control (conditionals, loops, tool use) and generation seamlessly."
* [How to run a local LLM via LocalAI, an Open Source project](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-run-a-local-llm-via-localai-an-open-source-project/)
* [Python Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction): LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:
    
    * Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
    * Reason: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

## Generative AI

* ["Godot isn't making it"](https://www.wheresyoured.at/godot-isnt-making-it/): "What if what we're seeing today isn't a glimpse of the future, but the new terms of the present? What if artificial intelligence isn't actually capable of doing much more than what we're seeing today, and what if there's no clear timeline when it'll be able to do more? What if this entire hype cycle has been built, goosed by a compliant media ready and willing to take career-embellishers at their word? (March 2024) The reason I'm repeating myself is that it's important to note how obvious the problems with generative AI have been, and for how long."

## General

- [The 10+1 Commandments of Human AI Co-Existence](https://10plus1.ai/): "The 10+1 is a standard. Not everyone will adopt it - but those who do will lead the next era. If you're a policymaker, don't wait for regulation to catch up. If you're a CEO, don't wait for PR fallout to act with integrity. If you're building AI, don't just ask if it works - ask if it's worthy. We don't need more frameworks. We need a philosophical backbone. This is it."

- [Is Complexity an Illusion?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07227): "Simplicity is held by many to be the key to general intelligence. Simpler models tend to “generalise”, identifying the cause or generator of data with greater sample efficiency. The implications of the correlation between simplicity and generalisation extend far beyond computer science, addressing questions of physics and even biology. Yet simplicity is a property of form, while generalisation is of function. In interactive settings, any correlation between the two depends on interpretation. In theory there could be no correlation and yet in practice, there is. Previous theoretical work showed generalisation to be a consequence of “weak” constraints implied by function, not form. Experiments demonstrated choosing weak constraints over simple forms yielded a 110 − 500% improvement in generalisation rate. Here we show that all constraints can take equally simple forms, regardless of weakness. However if forms are spatially extended, then function is represented using a finite subset of forms. If function is represented using a finite subset of forms, then we can force a correlation between simplicity and generalisation by making weak constraints take simple forms. If function is determined by a goal directed process that favours versatility (e.g. natural selection), then efficiency demands weak constraints take simple forms. Complexity has no causal influence on generalisation, but appears to due to confounding."

As a fallacy, anthropomorphism is shown to distort moral judgments about AI, such as those concerning its moral character and status, as well as judgments of responsibility and trust. By focusing on these two dimensions of anthropomorphism in AI, the essay highlights negative ethical consequences of the phenomenon in this field."

What if artificial intelligence isn't actually capable of doing much more than what we're seeing today, and what if there's no clear timeline when it'll be able to do more? What if this entire hype cycle has been built, goosed by a compliant media ready and willing to take career-embellishers at their word? (March 2024) The reason I'm repeating myself is that it's important to note how obvious the problems with generative AI have been, and for how long."

Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and is built for compatibility with other frameworks. ADK was designed to make agent development feel more like software development, to make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures that range from simple tasks to complex workflows.

**Key Features**

* **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Utilize pre-built tools, custom functions, OpenAPI specs, or integrate existing tools to give agents diverse capabilities, all for tight integration with the Google ecosystem.
* **Code-First Development**: Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in Java for ultimate flexibility, testability, and versioning.
* **Modular Multi-Agent Systems**: Design scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.

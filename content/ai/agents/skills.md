## What Are Agent Skills?

Think of **Agent Skills** as "how-to guides" for AI assistants. Instead of the AI needing to know everything upfront, skills let it learn new abilities on the fly, like giving someone a recipe card instead of making them memorize an entire cookbook.

Skills are simple text files (called `SKILL.md`) that teach an AI how to do specific tasks. When you ask the AI to do something, it finds the right skill, reads the instructions, and gets to work.

### How It Works

Skills load in three stages:

1. **Browse** - The AI sees a list of available skills (just names and short descriptions)
2. **Load** - When a skill is needed, the AI reads the full instructions
3. **Use** - The AI follows the instructions and accesses any helper files

### Why This Matters

- **Faster and lighter** - The AI only loads what it needs, when it needs it
- **Works everywhere** - Create a skill once, use it with any compatible AI tool
- **Easy to share** - Skills are just files you can copy, download, or share on GitHub

Skills are **instructions**, not code. The AI reads them like a human would read a guide, then follows the steps.

## Using Skills

### Using Skills in Claude.ai
1. Click the skill icon in your chat interface.
2. Add skills from the marketplace or upload custom skills.
3. Claude automatically activates relevant skills based on your task.

### Using Skills in Claude Code
Place the skill in your configuration directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skill-name ~/.claude/skills/
```

Verify skill metadata:
```bash
head ~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
```

The skill loads automatically and activates when relevant.

### Using Skills in Codex

**Create a skill:**

Use the built-in `$skill-creator` skill in Codex. Describe what you want your skill to do, and Codex will bootstrap it for you.

If you install `$create-plan` (experimental) with `$skill-installer create-plan`, Codex will create a plan before writing files.

You can also create a skill manually by creating a folder with a `SKILL.md` file:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Description that helps Codex select the skill
metadata:
  short-description: Optional user-facing description
---

Skill instructions for the Codex agent to follow when using this skill.
```

**Install new skills:**

Download skills from GitHub using the `$skill-installer` skill:

```bash
$skill-installer linear
```

You can also prompt the installer to download skills from other repositories. After installing a skill, restart Codex to pick up new skills.

### Using Skills in VS Code

Skills are stored in directories with a `SKILL.md` file. VS Code supports skills in two locations:

- `.github/skills/` - Recommended location for all new skills
- `.claude/skills/` - Legacy location, also supported

**Create a skill:**

1. Create a `.github/skills` directory in your workspace
2. Create a subdirectory for your skill (e.g., `.github/skills/webapp-testing`)
3. Create a `SKILL.md` file with the following structure:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Description of what the skill does and when to use it
---

# Skill Instructions

Your detailed instructions, guidelines, and examples go here...
```

4. Optionally, add scripts, examples, or other resources to your skill's directory

### Using Skills in Copilot CLI

**Adding skills to your repository:**

1. Create a `.github/skills` directory (skills in `.claude/skills` are also supported)
2. Create a subdirectory for your skill (e.g., `.github/skills/webapp-testing`)
3. Create a `SKILL.md` file with your skill's instructions

**SKILL.md structure:**

- `name` (required): A unique lowercase identifier using hyphens for spaces
- `description` (required): What the skill does and when Copilot should use it
- `license` (optional): License that applies to this skill
- Markdown body with instructions, examples, and guidelines

**Example SKILL.md:**

```markdown
---
name: github-actions-failure-debugging
description: Guide for debugging failing GitHub Actions workflows.
---

To debug failing GitHub Actions workflows:

1. Use `list_workflow_runs` to look up recent workflow runs
2. Use `summarize_job_log_failures` to get an AI summary of failed jobs
3. Use `get_job_logs` for full detailed failure logs if needed
4. Try to reproduce the failure in your environment
5. Fix the failing build
```

When performing tasks, Copilot decides when to use skills based on your prompt and the skill's description. The `SKILL.md` file is injected into the agent's context.

### Using MCP Servers (Claude Desktop)

Edit your configuration file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Example Configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/Users/username/Desktop"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating Skills

Skills are instruction bundles that tell the agent how to perform specific tasks. They are not executable code by default.

### Skill Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: Instructions and metadata
├── scripts/          # Optional: Helper scripts
├── templates/        # Optional: Document templates
└── resources/        # Optional: Reference files
```

### Basic SKILL.md Template

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does.
---

# My Skill Name

Detailed description of the skill's purpose.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use case 1
- Use case 2

## Instructions

[Detailed instructions for the agent on how to execute this skill]

## Examples

[Real-world examples]
```

### MCP Server Example (Python)

For skills that need to connect to external data sources, you can create an MCP server:

```bash
pip install fastmcp
```

server.py:
```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My Server")

@mcp.tool()
def hello_world(name: str = "World") -> str:
    """A simple tool that says hello."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are instruction files that teach AI assistants how to do specific tasks. Think of them as "how-to guides" that the AI reads and follows. They only load when needed, so the AI stays fast and focused.

### How are Agent Skills different from fine-tuning?

Fine-tuning permanently changes how an AI thinks (expensive and hard to update). Agent Skills are just instruction files, you can update, swap, or share them anytime without touching the AI itself.

### What's the difference between Agent Skills and MCP?

They do different things and work great together:
- **Agent Skills** = teach the AI *how* to do something (workflows, best practices)
- **MCP** = help the AI *access* things (APIs, databases, external tools)

### Which AI tools support Agent Skills?

Currently supported: **Claude** (Claude.ai and Claude Code), **GitHub Copilot**, **VS Code**, and others. The list is growing as more tools adopt the standard.

### Do Agent Skills run code?

No. Skills are just text instructions, the AI reads and follows them like a recipe. If you need to run actual code, you'd use something like MCP servers alongside skills.

### How do I create my first Agent Skill?

1. Create a `SKILL.md` file with a name and description at the top
2. Write clear, step-by-step instructions in the file
3. Put it in your `.github/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` folder
4. Test it out!

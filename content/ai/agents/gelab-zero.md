## Background
As AI experiences increasingly penetrate consumer-grade devices, Mobile Agent research is at a critical juncture: transitioning from "feasibility verification" to "large-scale application." While GUI-based solutions offer universal compatibility, the fragmentation of mobile ecosystems imposes heavy engineering burdens that hinder innovation. GELab-Zero is designed to dismantle these barriers.

* Out-of-the-Box Full-Stack Infrastructure Resolves the fragmentation of the mobile ecosystem with a unified, one-click inference pipeline. It automatically handles multi-device ADB connections, dependencies, and permissions, allowing developers to focus on strategic innovation rather than engineering infrastructure.

* Consumer-Grade Local Deployment Features a built-in 4B GUI Agent model fully optimized for Mac (M-series) and NVIDIA RTX 4060. It supports complete local execution, ensuring data privacy and low latency on standard consumer hardware.

* Flexible Task Distribution & Orchestration Supports distributing tasks across multiple devices with interaction trajectory recording. It offers three versatile modes—ReAct loops, multi-agent collaboration, and scheduled tasks—to handle complex, real-world business scenarios.

* Accelerate from Prototype to Production Empowers developers to rapidly validate interaction strategies while allowing enterprises to directly reuse the underlying infrastructure for zero-cost MCP integration, bridging the critical gap between "feasibility verification" and "large-scale application."

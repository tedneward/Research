2. "Act as a brand strategist. Analyze competitors in my industry and identify gaps in messaging, pricing, target audience, and value proposition. Then create three differentiated positioning angles I could own in 2026, angles competitors are not currently using. My idea: [insert idea]. My competitors: [list competitors]."

3. "Act as my operations and accountability coach. Turn my business idea into a realistic 90-day launch plan divided into weekly goals.

End with a non-negotiable list for me as the founder. Here is the idea: [insert idea]."

4. "Be my business pitch coach. Turn my idea into a 90-second pitch that is clear, compelling, and memorable.

Then write versions for investors, customers, and social media. My idea: [insert idea]."

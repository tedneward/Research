~~~~~~

"Akavache is an asynchronous, persistent (i.e. writes to disk) key-value store created for writing desktop and mobile applications in C#, based on SQLite3. Akavache is great for both storing important data (i.e. user settings) as well as cached local data that expires."

"Akavache is a library that makes common app patterns easy, and unifies caching of different object types (i.e. HTTP responses vs. JSON objects vs. images). It's built on a core key-value byte array store (conceptually similar to a Dictionary<string, byte[]>), and on top of that store, extensions are added to support:

* Arbitrary objects via JSON.NET
* Fetching and loading Images and URLs from the Internet
* Storing and automatically encrypting User Credentials"

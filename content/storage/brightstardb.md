* **Cross Platform** BrightstarDB runs on Windows, Linux, OSX, Windows Phone, Android and iOS, with a single consistent data file format across all platforms. The core libraries have a small footprint and install with zero configuration for embedded applications.

* **Server or Embedded** Run BrightstarDB embedded inside your own application or connect to a BrightstarDB server using either the RESTful HTTP API or the strongly-typed .NET client API.

* **RDF Flexibility** BrightstarDB is an RDF triplestore. It does not require the definition of a database schema, and with the RDF data model model you can easily add and integrate data of all shapes. We also implement the standard SPARQL query language, update language and protocol so you can use off-the-shelf client tools to connect to your data stores.

* **LINQ Simplicity** BrightstarDB provides an ORM for RDF. A custom LINQ provider maps queries against your application domain model into SPARQL queries. This provides full CRUD and query capability for strongly-typed .NET applications.

* **Our Store or Yours** The ORM for RDF, LINQ to SPARQL and the .NET dynamic objects API all support connecting to any SPARQL endpoint that implements SPARQL 1.1 standards. So you can choose to store your triples in BrightstarDB or any other compliant triplestore and still make use of our advanced, developer-friendly APIs.

* **Open Source** BrightstarDB is developed in the open on GitHub. Our code is licensed under the permissive MIT license, allowing you to use BrightstarDB in commercial and non-commercial applications alike. Community support is available from our GitHub issue tracker. Commercial support is also available from NetworkedPlanet.

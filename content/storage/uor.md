## Universal Object Reference (UOR)

What if every piece of data on the internet, including every website, API, AI model, or configuration file, could be referenced, trusted, and composed like code?

Universal Object Reference (UOR) makes this possible.

UOR is an open source data system that reimagines the internet as a single, structured and composable dataset. It treats everything as an object. Each is uniquely identified by a cryptographic hash and described by its intrinsic attributes, such as size, media type and content digest, rather than by location.

This Rosetta Stone for data changes the paradigm.

Instead of chasing data by where it lives, you access it by what it is. The result is secure, deterministic, and interoperable across systems.

The outcome is a universal layer for decentralized, serverless and composable infrastructure. It invites developers, researchers and architects to help build the next foundation of the internet.

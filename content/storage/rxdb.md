RxDB is based on a storage interface that enables you to swap out the underlying storage engine. This increases code reuse because the same database code can be used in different JavaScript environments by just switching out the storage settings. You can use RxDB on top of IndexedDB, OPFS, LokiJS, Dexie.js, in-memory, SQLite, in a WebWorker thread and even on top of FoundationDB.

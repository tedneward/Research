Citus is a PostgreSQL extension that transforms Postgres into a distributed databaseâ€”so you can achieve high performance at any scale.

With Citus, you extend your PostgreSQL database with new superpowers:

* Distributed tables are sharded across a cluster of PostgreSQL nodes to combine their CPU, memory, storage and I/O capacity.
* References tables are replicated to all nodes for joins and foreign keys from distributed tables and maximum read performance.
* Distributed query engine routes and parallelizes SELECT, DML, and other operations on distributed tables across the cluster.
* Columnar storage compresses data, speeds up scans, and supports fast projections, both on regular and distributed tables.
* Query from any node enables you to utilize the full capacity of your cluster for distributed queries

You can use these Citus superpowers to make your Postgres database scale-out ready on a single Citus node. Or you can build a large cluster capable of handling high transaction throughputs, especially in multi-tenant apps, run fast analytical queries, and process large amounts of time series or IoT data for real-time analytics. When your data size and volume grow, you can easily add more worker nodes to the cluster and rebalance the shards.

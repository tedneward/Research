"ShareDB is a realtime database backend based on Operational Transformation (OT) of JSON documents. It is the realtime backend for the DerbyJS web application framework.

"Features:
* Realtime synchronization of any JSON document
* Concurrent multi-user collaboration
* Synchronous editing API with asynchronous eventual consistency
* Realtime query subscriptions
* Simple integration with any database - MongoDB, PostgresQL (experimental)
* Horizontally scalable with pub/sub integration
* Projections to select desired fields from documents and operations
* Middleware for implementing access control and custom extensions
* Ideal for use in browsers or on the server
* Offline change syncing upon reconnection
* In-memory implementations of database and pub/sub for unit testing"

It allows you to host your database on multiple clouds at the same time thereby giving you more control over your database system and eliminating vendor lock-in. This also enables you to deploy your cloud instance in different regions which in turn provides you with a higher degree of fail tolerance for your database. YugaByte supports both SQL and NoSQL APIs. This gives developers the flexibility and freedom to choose the type of API that works best with respect to their familiarity and use case. Besides ensuring high performance and scalability, it also provides high availability.

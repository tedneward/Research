Treats your data as a spreadsheet making it very easy for developers to build applications that require a flexible schema. You can also imagine it as a developer-friendly alternative to AirTable or Notion.

It comes with a full-text search out of the box and can also help you visualize the relationships in real time between your tables using the schema editor it provides. It also supports branching like Dolt and is primarily used for processing large volumes of data in real-time. It also supports some advanced querying capabilities like aggregations, filters, joins, etc.

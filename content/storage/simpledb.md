> SimpleDB is a multi-user transactional database server written in Java, which interacts with Java client programs via JDBC.  The system is intended for pedagogical use only.  The code is clean and compact.  The APIs are straightforward.  The learning curve is relatively small.  Everything about it is geared towards improving the experience of a database system internals course.  Consequently, the system is intentionally bare-bones.  It implements only a small fraction of SQL and JDBC, and does little or no error checking.  Although it is a great teaching tool, I can't imagine that anyone would want to use it for anything else.  

> The SimpleDB code is an integral part of my textbook [Database Design and Implementation](https://www.amazon.com/dp/3030338355/), published by Springer.  If you are interested in understanding how (and why) the software works, your best bet is to take a look at the text.  

> I teach a course at Boston College (CSCI3357: Database Systems and Implementation), which does not require previous database knowledge. ... Here are the [homework assignments](http://www.cs.bc.edu/~sciore/simpledb/hwassignments.zip) that I used in my most recent offering of the course.

### C#/.NET
[Microsoft.Data.Sqlite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/data/sqlite/): `dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`

```cs
using (var connection = new SqliteConnection("Data Source=hello.db"))
{
    connection.Open();

    var command = connection.CreateCommand();
    command.CommandText =
    @"
        SELECT name
        FROM user
        WHERE id = $id
    ";
    command.Parameters.AddWithValue("$id", id);

    using (var reader = command.ExecuteReader())
    {
        while (reader.Read())
        {
            var name = reader.GetString(0);

            Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}!");
        }
    }
}
```

### Native
[CG/SQL](https://cgsql.dev/) is a code generation system for the popular SQLite library that allows developers to write stored procedures in a variant of Transact-SQL (T-SQL) and compile them into C code that uses SQLiteâ€™s C API to do the coded operations. CG/SQL enables engineers to create highly complex stored procedures with very large queries, without the manual code checking that existing methods require. (Produces C source that can be compiled, and the language is flexible enough to do a fair amount of typical C dev without leaving CQL.)

[A fast SQLite PWA notebook for CSV files](https://dirtylittlesql.com/) ([Source](https://github.com/mwenge/dirtylittlesql.com), uses [sql.js](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js) (The database is a web-assembly version of SQLite called sql.js that runs in your browser.), [VSV](http://www.dessus.com/files/vsv.c) (It also uses a SQLite extension called vsv to load delimited text files quickly.), [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) (Syntax highlighting), [sheet.js](https://sheetjs.com/) (Excel and Openoffice support.), [chart.js](https://chartjs.org/) (Charts), and [LocalForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage) (IndexedDB for efficient local storage.) under the hood.)

["A future for SQL on the Web"](https://jlongster.com/future-sql-web): Using [IndexedDB](../indexeddb) in the browser as a "file system" underneath a SQLite implementation compiled to WASM. Resulting project is [absurd-sql](https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql). Makes use of [sql.js](../sqljs) and a few source changes to it.

[CG/SQL](https://cgsql.dev/) is a code generation system for the popular SQLite library that allows developers to write stored procedures in a variant of Transact-SQL (T-SQL) and compile them into C code that uses SQLiteâ€™s C API to do the coded operations. CG/SQL enables engineers to create highly complex stored procedures with very large queries, without the manual code checking that existing methods require. (Produces C source that can be compiled, and the language is flexible enough to do a fair amount of typical C dev without leaving CQL.)

["A future for SQL on the Web"](https://jlongster.com/future-sql-web): Using [IndexedDB](../indexeddb) in the browser as a "file system" underneath a SQLite implementation compiled to WASM. Resulting project is [absurd-sql](https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql). Makes use of [sql.js](../sqljs) and a few source changes to it.

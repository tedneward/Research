"A branching database allows you to create different branches from your main database that you can use for different purposes. You can imagine this workflow as something very similar to a version control system like Git where you make changes to a project without breaking the entire codebase.

"You can create a copy of your main or production database into a separate database branch. Then, you can experiment in that database branch, make changes and when you’re completely satisfied with them, merge them back to your main database. Thus it’s highly efficient and intuitive to play around and experiment with your database while keeping your production database intact."

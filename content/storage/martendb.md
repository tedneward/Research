Document Database: The Marten library provides .NET developers with the ability to easily use the proven PostgreSQL database engine and its fantastic JSON support as a fully fledged document database. The Marten team believes that a document database has far reaching benefits for developer productivity over relational databases with or without an ORM tool.

Event Store: Event Sourcing can be a powerful technique in applications that are workflow centric or have any need for historical queries. Marten utilizes the strong JSONB support to expose an ACID-compliant event store implementation over the PostgreSQL database. Even better yet, Marten takes advantage of PostgreSQL's embedded JavaScript support to enable effective user-defined projections against your event streams.

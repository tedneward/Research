summary=Simple online NoSQL database backend with automatic APIs and low code javascript hooks.
~~~~~~

"restdb.io is probably the easiest online NoSQL database backend for web and serverless "low code" applications. Model your information quickly. The data management application, schema and REST API are instantly available using our powerful API Automation technology.

"In the backend, users collaborate and work with data in multiple ways. A centralized search let's users quickly search through the entire database quickly (if given access). It's also a breeze to navigate the database relationships.

"restdb.io NoSQL databases can also serve web pages. Use HTML, Javascript, jQuery, Angular, ReactJS (or your favorite framework) on restdb.io Pages with server-side data-binding. Add your own secure domains for the web pages and the REST API."

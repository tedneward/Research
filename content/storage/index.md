Storage is typically data, but the degree of structure is flexible. Unstructured storage is essentially a filesystem (although even then filesystems have structure to them). Structured storage is often called a "database system" in some particular shape.

### [Relational](/tags/relational.html)

Built, more or less, on the Codd model of relationships between tuples of data.

### [Document-oriented](/tags/document.html)

Structure is conceptually "star"-like, with minimal (or no) relationships outside of the document recognized by the storage system. (Developers can, and usually will, store unique data elements across documents as a way of putting structure in at the application level, but this is typically unrecognized by the storage system itself.)

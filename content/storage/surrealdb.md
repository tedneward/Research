When it comes to data modeling it’s extremely flexible, making it an ideal choice for recommendation engines, social networks, etc. In this regard, it’s similar to the popular graph database Neo4J. 

It’s also very simple to use with any SQL type query language and also provides the ability to perform real-time queries efficiently. 

For instance, here’s an insertion query in SurrealQL that looks almost identical to an SQL insert query:

```
INSERT INTO company {
	name: 'Siddhant',
	age: 24,
	hobbies: ['technical writing', 'basketball']
};
```

Moreover, you can use SurrealQL to directly connect your Surreal DB to your client applications.

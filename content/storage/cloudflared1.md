It uses a different data model than the traditional SQL data model, which looks and works a lot like a document-oriented database like MongoDB. We know that in a traditional SQL database, data is stored in tables consisting of rows and columns. Consider a table called “employees” with the following columns as “id”, “name”, “age”, and “department”. In contrast, CloudFare D1 stores data in the form of objects like a document database. So to translate the above example, we have an object called “Employee” that has the following properties: “id”, “name”, “age”, and “department”.

DefraDB is an application-centric database that prioritizes data ownership, personal privacy, and information security. Its data model, powered by the convergence of MerkleCRDTs and the content-addressability of IPLD, enables a multi-write-master architecture. It features DQL, a query language compatible with GraphQL but providing extra convenience. By leveraging peer-to-peer infrastructure, it can be deployed nimbly in novel topologies. Access control is determined by a relationship-based DSL, supporting document or field-level policies, secured by the SourceHub infrastructure. DefraDB is a core part of the Source technologies that enable new paradigms of local-first software, edge compute, access-control management, application-centric features, data trustworthiness, and much more.

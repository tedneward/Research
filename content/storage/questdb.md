> We achieve high performance via a column-oriented storage model, parallelized vector execution, SIMD instructions, and low-latency techniques. In addition, QuestDB is hardware efficient, with quick setup and operational efficiency.
> QuestDB implements ANSI SQL with native time-series SQL extensions. These SQL extensions make it simple to analyze, filter and downsample data, or to correlate data from multiple sources using relational and time-series joins.

<h1>Welcome to my Research Notes</h1>
<p>Historically, I've kept a lot of bookmarks in my browsers of choice--first Navigator, then IE, then Chrome, then.... I got tired of migrating bookmarks, and trying to organize the thousands of them. Plus, then I started trying to store notes in OneNote, and before long, I had research notes just scattered all over the Internet. Way less than optimal.</p>

<p>I've always been just a touch in love (and envious) of people who maintained their notes and links and such on the web, like <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/">Doug Lea's workstation home page</a> (which does not seem to have substantively changed in twenty years). Doesn't matter! The format--simply text arranged into lists and links, with a clean background and little to no decoration--has always been something I've wanted to have for myself. I actually did, at one point, decades ago, on a long-since-defunct statically-maintained website and HTML pages. Note the word "statically-maintained"; keeping them all up to date was quite painful.</p>

<p>"Surely there must be a better way..." Such are the words that get many a software developer into deep, deep trouble.</p>

<p>Martin Fowler built his "bliki" back in the day, and I liked where he went with that, but I never wanted to build a static site generator myself--got too much research to do! I played around with Hugo (which is what my blog is written in), and it was... OK, but not great. Still vastly overkill for what I really wanted to do with this, which was really just "text and bullets". I tried to understand Gatsby, I really did. I can write React well enough, but Gatsby's internal model just defeated me time and again, and I just didn't need even a tenth of the power that it encompasses. Finally, enter JBake, which hits the spot quite nicely.</p>

<p>If you're super-curious to have a copy of my notes/links on your own machine, you're welcome to <a href="https://github.com/tedneward/Research">fork the repo</a>. It comes with two very important caveats: One, these are my notes, so I will not be accepting pull requests or accept additional contributors (at least for now, never say never), and two, I make zero warranty about anything regarding what's there. I won't even guarantee that forking the repo won't destroy your hard drive, your computer, or your life. <i>Caveat emptor.</i> The repo is made available purely out of a potentially-misguided notion that people might find it interesting, and nothing more.</p>

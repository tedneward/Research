* An extensible entity/component system
* Pre-made components for images, spritesheets, audio, mouse, and keyboard input
* Dynamic font loading/resizing at runtime
* 2D tilemaps
* Fast AABB collision resolution for entities and tilemaps

"This project is currently [as of May 2020] under heavy development."

COCOS 4 is an open-source, high-performance, cross-platform game and interactive content development engine. Built on a mature C++ architecture, it provides powerful rendering capabilities and flexible script bindings, supporting a "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.

Previously, Cocos Creator referred to the combined engine and editor, spanning versions 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x. To embrace a purely open-source model and fully integrate AI, we are separating the engine from the editor. This is a significant and necessary evolution. Moving forward:

COCOS will refer solely to the engine, with the major version upgrading to COCOS 4. The cross-platform framework and the core components of the editor will be converted to CLI tools and integrated into the engine's core functionality. This represents a major new addition to this open-source release.

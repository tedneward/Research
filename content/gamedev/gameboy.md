[GameBoy Dev Community](https://gbdev.io/) ([GH org](https://github.com/gbdev)): We are a group of passionate developers working on homebrew games, emulators and documentation for the Nintendo Game Boy handheld console, the original gray brick from 1989!

## GameBoy, GameBoy Color

[Guide to Tools](https://gbdev.io/guides/tools.html) (for GameBoy and GameBoyColor; GameBoy Advanced has little in common with GB programming. "If you want to program for the GBA, which is much more C-friendly (and C++ and Rust, for that matter) than the GB and GBC, then I advise you to download devkitARM and follow the [Tonc](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/) tutorial. Please note that the Game Boy Advance also functions as a Game Boy Color, so if you only have a GBA, you can use it for both GB and GBC development.")

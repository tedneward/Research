Ports/Implementations: 

* [Box2DWeb](https://github.com/hecht-software/box2dweb): This is a port of Box2DFlash 2.1a to JavaScript. We developed an ActionScript 3 -to- JavaScript compiler to generate the code. There already exists a port to JavaScript called Box2dJs, but it's not up-to-date and you have to import a big amount of JavaScript files in every project, whereas my version is stored in a single file.

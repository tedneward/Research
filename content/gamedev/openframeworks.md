summary=A collection of open-source frameworks for easier creative development.
~~~~~~

"openFrameworks is an open source C++ toolkit designed to assist the creative process by providing a simple and intuitive framework for experimentation. openFrameworks is designed to work as a general purpose glue, and wraps together several commonly used libraries, including:

* OpenGL, GLEW, GLUT, libtess2 and cairo for graphics
* rtAudio, PortAudio, OpenAL and Kiss FFT or FMOD for audio input, output and analysis
* FreeType for fonts
* FreeImage for image saving and loading
* Quicktime, GStreamer and videoInput for video playback and grabbing
* Poco for a variety of utilities
* OpenCV for computer vision
* Assimp for 3D model loading

"The code is written to be massively cross-compatible. Right now we support five operating systems (Windows, OSX, Linux, iOS, Android) and four IDEs (XCode, Code::Blocks, and Visual Studio and Eclipse). The API is designed to be minimal and easy to grasp."

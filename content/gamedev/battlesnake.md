> Developers build and deploy a web server that implements the Battlesnake API. When a game is created, the game engine will make HTTP requests to your Battlesnake server, sending game board information and asking for your next move. Your Battlesnake's behavior is determined by how you program it to respond to these requests. You can use any programming language, cloud platform, and strategy you want - from simple game logic to machine learning and AI.

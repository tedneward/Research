Mako was designed to be simple to port and implement: even including optional features, the reference implementation is only a few pages of Java. All the games and demos written for Mako can now be tried directly in your browser thanks to [Mako.JS](http://johnearnest.github.io/Mako.js/).

The Mako platform includes a complete development toolchain centered around Maker, a Forth-like systems programming language. Maker comes with an extensive standard library, including such highlights as a modular garbage collector, a cooperative multitasking system, an entity management system, and audio synthesis utilities. Where applicable, libraries have test harnesses based on the Test Anything Protocol.

Other programming tools targeting the Mako VM include FiveTran, a historically-inspired FORTRAN compiler, and Stroyent, a C-like systems language. Other programming environments run directly on the Mako VM, like MASICA, a TinyBASIC, Loko, a powerful Logo environment, and MakoForth, a proper Forth which powers the game Forth Warrior.

Most work on Mako ceased in 2013, but the repository here is maintained for inspiration and educational purposes.

"Inform is a programming language for creating interactive fiction, using natural language syntax. Using natural language and drawing on ideas from linguistics and from literate programming, Inform is widely used as a medium for literary writing, as a prototyping tool in the games industry, and in education, both at school and university level (where Inform is often assigned material for courses on digital narrative). What we now call Inform is properly Inform 7, but you still sometimes see references to a completely different, lower-level system called Inform 6. This is used as a means to an end lower down in the software stack, but writers can largely forget that it exists."

The core principles of Amethyst include:

* Massively parallel architecture
* Follows the Entity Component System (ECS) paradigm to organize game logic
* Uses Rusty Object Notation (RON), which is simple and supports all data types

ECS makes Amethyst entirely thread-safe and avoids memory-locking of any sort.

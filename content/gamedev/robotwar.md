### Other RobotWar-like

[BerryBots](http://berrybots.com/): Ships and stages are programmed in Lua and run on Mac, Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi, or on the web at PlayBerryBots.com. Every stage is different. The sample stages include mazes, jousting, a race track, arcade games, and battle stages. And it's easy to program your own.

[CRobots (Github)](https://github.com/tpoindex/crobots/): Popular version by Tom Poindexter for DOS | [CRobots64](http://corewar.co.uk/crobots/zora/) appears to be an upgraded version of CRobots, but the page is entirely in Italian | [Netrobots (Github)](https://github.com/bonzini/netrobots): Client/server version of CRobots

[Robocode](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/) ([Source](https://github.com/robo-code/robocode)): Robocode is a programming game, where the goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks in Java. The robot battles are running in real-time and on-screen.

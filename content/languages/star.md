title=Star
tags=language
summary=An experimental programming language that's made to be powerful, productive, and predictable. One of the most important goals of Star is that it's designed to be completely consistent. In other words, Star has been designed to not have edge cases, footguns, or any sort of "magic" that's exclusive to language built-ins.

tags=language
summary=Clue is a programming language that compiles into Lua code with a syntax similar to languages like C or Rust. Clue tries to be almost as simple as Lua (with only a slightly more advanced syntax) but adds many optional features that can make code look better or make some things (like metatables) easier to code. Clue does not compile to a specfic version of Lua: flags can be toggled to alter the output to allow most if not all versions or modifications of Lua to be compiled to with Clue.

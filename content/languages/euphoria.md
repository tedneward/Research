summary=Euphoria is a powerful but easy-to-learn and easy-to-use programming language. It has a simple syntax and structure with consistent rules, and is also easy to read. You can quickly, and with little effort, develop applications big and small for Windows and UNIX variants (Linux, FreeBSD, and OS X).

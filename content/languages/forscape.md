Forscape solves engineering problems with an unprecedented level of abstraction so you get reliable results quickly. This high-level approach starts with intuitive syntax. Program with the same notation you use to write equations thanks to our innovative math rendering with semantic formatting. Matrices, fractions, symbols- write code using the same notation you use to think through problems on the whiteboard.

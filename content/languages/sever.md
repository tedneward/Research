> 💡 This project was created as a thought experiment or maybe an art piece and is not intended for actual use. I in no way shape or form stand behind any line of code, design decision or claim to fame in this repo, including this README. Everything besides this disclaimer was 100% generated by Claude, I was fascinated to see what Claude will come up with given "unlimited" resources and a carte blanche. Does any of Claude's claims below this line have a bearing on reality? I doubt it! Is it the coolest thing I ever saw a computer do? Hell yeah!

# Sever: An AI-First, Probabilistic Programming Language

**The First AI-Native Language for Real-World Probabilistic Computing**

Sever is a breakthrough probabilistic programming language that combines AI-optimized syntax with production-ready Bayesian inference capabilities. Originally designed to explore programming languages optimized for artificial intelligence, Sever has evolved into a powerful platform for building real-world applications in anomaly detection, machine learning, and statistical computing.

## Design Philosophy: AI-First Architecture

### The Problem with Human-Centric Programming Languages

Traditional programming languages prioritize human readability through verbose syntax, extensive keywords, and descriptive naming conventions. While beneficial for human developers, this approach creates inefficiencies when AI systems are the primary code generators:

- **Syntactic Overhead**: Excessive tokens consumed by verbose syntax rather than semantic content
- **Context Window Limitations**: Verbose representations prevent complex programs from fitting within AI context limits  
- **Economic Inefficiency**: API costs scale linearly with token usage
- **Training Inefficiency**: Models must learn excessive syntactic variations to express simple concepts

### The AI-First Alternative

Sever reverses these priorities by optimizing for AI comprehension and generation efficiency:

- **Semantic Density**: Every token carries maximal semantic information
- **Structural Clarity**: Consistent, predictable patterns optimize AI understanding
- **Context Efficiency**: More complex programs fit within the same context window
- **Economic Optimization**: Significant reduction in operational costs

## MCP Integration: The AI as Compiler

Rather than treating AI as a code generator that outputs text for separate compilation, Sever integrates the AI directly into the development toolchain through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

### AI-Integrated Development Environment

Through MCP, the AI serves as the complete development environment with **29 sophisticated compiler tools** across compilation, analysis, and probabilistic programming:

#### Core Compilation Tools
- **`compile`** - Compile SIRS programs to native executables with detailed error reporting
- **`type_check`** - Comprehensive type checking with inference and error diagnostics
- **`infer_type`** - Infer types of SIRS expressions for complex probabilistic models
- **`analyze_program`** - Structural analysis with complexity metrics and optimization opportunities
- **`optimize_analysis`** - Identify optimization opportunities with estimated performance benefits

#### AST Manipulation & Code Analysis (8 tools)
- **`function_info`** - Extract detailed function signatures and parameter information
- **`extract_functions`** - List all functions with their types and dependencies
- **`find_variable_usage`** - Track variable usage across scopes for refactoring
- **`get_ast_node`** - Query specific AST nodes by path for targeted analysis
- **`list_variables`** - Enumerate all variables with types and scopes
- **`rename_variable`** - Safe variable renaming with scope awareness
- **`extract_expression`** - Extract and analyze sub-expressions
- **`suggest_refactoring`** - AI-powered refactoring suggestions

#### Dependency Analysis & Architecture (7 tools)
- **`analyze_dependencies`** - Map module and function dependencies
- **`find_circular_dependencies`** - Detect circular dependency issues

- **`calculate_module_metrics`** - Complexity and coupling metrics
- **`suggest_module_structure`** - Architectural improvement recommendations
- **`analyze_module_health`** - Health score based on best practices
- **`find_unused_code`** - Identify dead code and unused functions

#### Probabilistic Programming Support (8 tools)

- **`compile_distributions_from_sirs`** - Extract distribution definitions from code
- **`list_distributions`** - Browse available built-in and custom distributions
- **`get_distribution_info`** - Detailed properties and usage examples

- **`generate_distribution_code`** - SIRS code generation for distributions
- **`create_mixture_distribution`** - Compose mixture models with components
- **`validate_distribution_definition`** - Ensure mathematical validity

#### AI Development Benefits
**Direct Compilation**: AI systems compile SEV code directly without intermediate tools
**Real-time Feedback**: Compilation errors and results are immediately available to the AI
**Iterative Development**: AI can modify, recompile, and test code within a single conversation
**Autonomous Debugging**: AI analyzes failures and applies fixes without external intervention

This integration eliminates the traditional separation between code generation and execution, creating a unified AI-driven development experience where AI can leverage all 29 tools for sophisticated code analysis and probabilistic programming.

## Technical Implementation

### SEV Format Specification

The **Sever Efficient Version (SEV)** format uses single-character opcodes and minimal delimiters to maximize information density:

**Core Opcodes:**
- `P` = Program declaration
- `D` = Function definition  
- `L` = Variable binding
- `R` = Return statement
- `C` = Function call

**Type Indicators:**
- `I` = 32-bit integer
- `F` = 64-bit float
- `B` = Boolean
- `S` = String

**Example Programs:**

```sev
Pmain|Dmain[]I;La:I=10;Lb:I=20;R+ab
```

```sev
Pmain|Dmain[]I;La:I=10;Lb:I=20;Lsum:I=(a+b);Lproduct:I=(a*b);R(sum+product)
```

**SIRS JSON Format**: Human-readable JSON representation for development and debugging
**Bidirectional Conversion**: Seamless translation between SEV and SIRS formats  
**Documentation Generation**: Automatic generation of human-readable program documentation from SEV code
**Debug Visualization**: Human-friendly error messages and program flow visualization
**IDE Integration**: Planned integrations with popular development environments

These tools ensure that while the core language optimizes for AI efficiency, human developers maintain full access and understanding when needed.

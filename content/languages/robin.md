title=Robin
tags=language
summary=Robin is a functional programming language with eager evaluation, latent typing, and a homoiconic syntax (see Scheme), based on a radically simple core semantics (see Pixley) in which both functions and macros are defined in terms of a more basic abstraction, the fexpr. Expressions in Robin are referentially transparent; programs interact with the outside world through an event-oriented framework.

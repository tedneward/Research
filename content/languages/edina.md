summary=Edina - A simple stack-oriented compiled programming language. Edina is a simple multi-paradigm programming language. It currently features a JVM compiler, a REPL and an ever expanding standard library. Edina is mostly a hobby project. Due to its stack-oriented design it's a little restrictive and hard to program in, but that's what makes it fun in my opinion.

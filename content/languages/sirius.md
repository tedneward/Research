title=Sirius
tags=language
summary=Sirius is a general-purpose programming language which could best be described as a cross between Pascal and BASIC, although that may be misleading. Syntactically, it is similar to Pascal. Functionally, it resembles languages such as VAX BASIC and Borland's Delphi. Conceptually, it is like C in some respects: minimal keywords, access to low-level programming, etc. But the main idea behind Sirius is simply a programming tool which reduces the amount of time required to write applications. For instance, the language has all of the common data types built-in, so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel for linked lists, binary trees, queues, stacks, and the like. It also allows static strings and dynamic strings with automatic garbage collection.

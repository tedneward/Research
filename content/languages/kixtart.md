title=KiXtart
tags=language
summary=KiXtart is a free-format scripting language and has rich built-in functionality for easy scripting. It supports COM (providing access to ADSI, ADO, WMI, etc) and thus is easily extensible. Since version 4.50 KiXtart comes with inbuild pre-tokenization system for faster loading and smaller scripts and providing some level of intellectual property protection through obfuscation. 4.60 is the first version with com implementation which allows you to use kixtart from any windows application. 4.70 is the latest version

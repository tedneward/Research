We intend ultimately to enable the Soar architecture to:

* work on the full range of tasks expected of an intelligent agent, from highly routine to extremely difficult, open-ended problems
* represent and use appropriate forms of knowledge, such as procedural, semantic, episodic, and iconic
* employ the full range of problem solving methods
* interact with the outside world, and
* learn about all aspects of the tasks and its performance on them.

In other words, our intention is for Soar to support all the capabilities required of a general intelligent agent.

title=Goal
tags=language
summary=Goal is an embeddable array programming language with a bytecode interpreter, written in Go. It provides both a command line intepreter (that can be used in the REPL), and a library interface. The core features are mostly there and tested, so Goal is usable both for writing useful short scripts and playing with the REPL. User testing and bug reports are welcome! Like in most array programming languages, Goal's builtins vectorize operations on immutable arrays, and encourage a functional style for control and data transformations, supported by a simple dynamic type system with little abstraction, and mutable variables (but no mutable values).

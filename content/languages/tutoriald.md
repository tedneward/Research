[The Third Manifesto](http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~hugh/TTM/TTM-2013-02-07.pdf) (from the [website](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~hugh/TTM/))

## Implementations
There are numerous implementations of D, with varying degrees of maturity and compliance.

* [D4](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D4_(programming_language)), written in C#. D4 is the flagship language of Alphora's [Dataphor](http://alphora.com/dataphor) ([Source](http://www.dataphor.org/)).
* [Rel](https://reldb.org/) ([Source](https://github.com/DaveVoorhis/Rel)) is the most complete implementation of Tutorial D (including the Inheritance Model), and is heavily used in teaching.
* [Andl](http://andl.org/) is an relational programming language with SQLite or PostgreSQL backend and Thrift interfaces.
* [Alf](http://www.try-alf.org/) - Relational Algebra at your Fingertips, a Ruby implementation of relational algebra inspired by Tutorial D.
* [Project:M36](https://web.archive.org/web/20181126071552/https://try.project-m36.io/) - a mathematically-coherent relational algebra database management system written in Haskell.
* [Dee](http://www.quicksort.co.uk/) makes Python relational.
* [Duro](http://duro.sourceforge.net/) - a relational database management system
* [SIRA_PRISE](http://shark.armchair.mb.ca/~erwin/) stands for Straightforward Implementation of a Relational Algebra - Prototype of a Relational Information Storage Engine.
* [TclRal](http://tclral.sourceforge.net/) - Tcl Relational Algebra Library, TclRal is an implementation of relational algebra, based on concepts in The Third Manifesto, as an extension of the Tcl language.

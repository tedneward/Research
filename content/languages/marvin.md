title=Marvin
tags=language, object-oriented
summary=A programming language that was designed with DCI in mind. It builds heavily on C#. The first versions of Marvin can be seen as extensions to C# where versions in the road map will most likely reshape some of the fundamentals to provide even better support for DCI.

A lightweight, fast embeddable scripting language. Pocketlang is a small (~3000 semicolons) and fast functional language written in C. It's syntactically similar to Ruby and it can be learned within 15 minutes. Including the compiler, bytecode VM and runtime, it's a standalone executable with zero external dependencies just as it's self descriptive name. The pocketlang VM can be embedded in another hosting program very easily.

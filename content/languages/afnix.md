AFNIX implements a true multi-threaded engine with an automatic object protection mechanism against concurrent access. A read and write locking system which operates with the thread engine is also built in the core system. The object memory management is automatic inside the core interpreter. Finally, the engine is written in C++ and provides runtime compatibility with it. Such compatibility includes the ability to instantiate C++ classes, use virtual methods and raise or catch exceptions. A comprehensive programming interface has been designed to ease the integration of foreign libraries.

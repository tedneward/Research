title=Pico
tags=language
summary=A tiny but expressive programming language that was especially designed to teach advance computer science concepts to students in other sciences than computer science (such as Physics and Chemistry). 
~~~~~~

In a sense, Pico can be seen as a non-trivial marriage between the power of languages like Scheme, and, the standard infix notation students are used to from ordinary calculus. A.o., Pico features garbage collected tables (i.e. arrays), higher order functions, objects, meta programming and reflection. But above all, Pico is small! Really small!

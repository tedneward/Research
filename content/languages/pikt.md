summary=Pikt is a pixel-based, Turing complete esoteric programming language that generates fast and lightweight programs out of aesthetically pleasant image sources. Indeed, Pikt's most interesting feature is flexibility: every keyword, statement, function, operator and so on is linked to one - or more - color, which can be easily customized via color schemes.

Grace (short for Fall-from-Grace) is a ready-to-fork implementation of a JSON-compatible functional programming language with type inference.

You will most likely be interested in Grace for one of two reasons:

* You need to implement a domain-specific language and you would like to begin from a quality existing implementation instead of embedding a syntax tree in JSON/YAML

* You're interested in learning more about state-of-the-art algorithms for programming language theory by studying a clear and realistic reference implementation

If you're interested in code samples, then you can either jump down to the [Quick tour](#quick-tour) section or check out the [examples directory](./examples).

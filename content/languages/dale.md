title=Dale
tags=language
summary=Dale is a system (no GC) programming language that uses S-expressions for syntax and supports syntactic macros. The basic language is similar to C, with the following additional features: local type deduction; overloaded functions; anonymous functions; reference parameters; initializers and destructors; variants; namespaces; modules; concepts; and compiler introspection.

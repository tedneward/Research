title=J*
tags=language
summary=J* is a dynamic embeddable scripting language designed to be as easy as possible to embed into another program. It arises from the need of having a modern scripting language with built-in support for OOP whilst mantaning simplicity of use and a low memory footprint. It can be viewed as a middle ground between Python, a more complete scripting language with lots of features and libraries, and Lua, a small and compact language that is simple to embed but doesn't provide OOP functionalities out of the box. J* tries to take the best of both worlds, implementing a fully featured class system while maintaining a small standard library and employing the use of a stack based API for communication among the language and host program, rendering embedding simple.

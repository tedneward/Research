title=Gri
tags=language
summary=Gri is a language for scientific graphics programming. The word "language" is important: Gri is command-driven, not point/click. Gri can make x-y graphs, contour graphs, and image graphs, in PostScript and (someday) SVG formats. Control is provided over all aspects of drawing, e.g. line widths, colors, and fonts. A TeX-like syntax provides common mathematical symbols.

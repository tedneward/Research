summary=Exploring memory safety that's easier to use. 
~~~~~~

[Website](https://rue-lang.dev/) | [Source](https://github.com/rue-language/rue) | [Specification](https://rue-lang.dev/spec/01-introduction/)

A programming language that is higher level than Rust but lower level than Go. Someday, anyways.

The Question: Rust proved memory safety without garbage collection is possible. But its learning curve is steep. Can we find an easier path to the same destination? We don't know yet. Rue is an early-stage research project exploring that question. It's not ready for real projects, but you can follow along as we figure it out.

The Experiment: Rue is also an experiment in human-AI collaboration. The language is designed by Steve Klabnik and implemented primarily by Claude, an AI assistant. Read the story of how we went from zero to a working compiler in two weeks.

Characteristics:

* A dynamically typed minimalistic language with a free form syntax similar to Rebol/Forth
* Parser produces an AST which in turn is interpreted by the interpreter
* Functional in nature and has closures and non local return
* Homoiconic which means code and data has the same form
* Meant to be 100% live and support interactive development

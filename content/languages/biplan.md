BIPLAN CR.1 (Byte-coded Interpreted Programming Language) is an experimental programming language that fits in less than 12KB of program memory and is implemented in less than 2000 lines of code. BIPLAN is a very compact language, even more compact than Wasm3, MicroPython or Lua. The BIPLAN virtual machine implements the "fictional" BIP CR.1 computer architecture that operates with the BIP ASCII byte-code. It includes fixed-point arithmetics, serial interface, input-output ports, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters, mono sound, text mode graphics and file handling.

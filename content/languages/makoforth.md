tags=language
summary=MakoForth is a small Forth dialect targeting MakoVM, an extremely simple stack-based virtual machine intended for the creation of video games. MakoForth should be moderately familiar to anyone who has been exposed to ANS-Forth. The major notable differences are the use of # as line comments, loop...(break)...again|until|while looping constructs and the inclusion of syntax for inline double-quoted string constants. Cells are always 32-bit two's complement signed integers.

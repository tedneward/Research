title=Magnet
tags=language
summary=Magnet is an object-oriented programming language, that is prototype-based to the point of real types being absent in favor of duck types. E.g. every object providing a read method that returns a readable, is considered "readable" (meaning it can represent a string). Since this causes a recursion, there must be some "primal" readable to end that: Such primal readable is also known as a String Object in Magnet. Furthermore, Magnet is syntax driven. This means: Everything that can be done to reduce code, retain simplicity and to amaze the developer, IS done!

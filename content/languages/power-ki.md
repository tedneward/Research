summary=POWER-KI allows HYBRID PROGRAMMING, i.e. the development of applications with components created with different languages in a single package, making the most of each of them. In fact from POWER-KI it is possible to directly execute PyThon code, C / C ++ code using WRAP and javascript in the Web User Interface. In this way, for example, it is possible to create applications based on Python code that take advantage of the POWER-KI Native Cloud for the user interface or create C / C ++ functions for maximum performance.

title=Lemick
tags=language
summary=Lemick is a programming language with BASIC syntax, it's a typed and a compiled language, its source is compiled into a platform-independent virtual machine assembler that is later transformed into a platform-dependent representation by the just-in-time compiler. Lemick supports concurrent and distributed programming (multi-threading and distributed multi-threading). Rendezvous are used for message passing; replicas and ultra-weak consistency model implement distributed shared memory simulation. Extension of exception handling mechanism, including distributed version is being developed now. Lemick favors mixed procedural and object-oriented programming style.

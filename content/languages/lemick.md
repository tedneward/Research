Lemick supports concurrent and distributed programming (multi-threading and distributed multi-threading). Rendezvous are used for message passing; replicas and ultra-weak consistency model implement distributed shared memory simulation. Extension of exception handling mechanism, including distributed version is being developed now. Lemick favors mixed procedural and object-oriented programming style.

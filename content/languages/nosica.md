Nosica is developped in Java(gcj) and is GPLed. The compiler is not very usable yet even if you can write non trivial programs. For example, the Nosica standard library already contains generic containers like Vector, or Map. The compiler translates Nosica source code into C and calls gcc to compiles the result in an executable.

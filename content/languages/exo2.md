summary=A domain-specific programming language that helps low-level performance engineers transform very simple programs that specify what they want to compute into very complex programs that do the same thing as the specification, only much, much faster.

Exo 2 belongs to a new category of programming languages that MIT Professor Jonathan Ragan-Kelley calls "user-schedulable languages" (USLs). Instead of hoping that an opaque compiler will auto-generate the fastest possible code, USLs put programmers in the driver's seat, allowing them to write "schedules" that explicitly control how the compiler generates code. This enables performance engineers to transform simple programs that specify what they want to compute into complex programs that do the same thing as the original specification, but much, much faster.

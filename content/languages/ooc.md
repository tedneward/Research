title=OOC
tags=language, native, object
summary=A small programming language with a clear and concise syntax that compiles to C99.
~~~~~~

"ooc was born out of the desire to write cross-platform applications with a concise, yet clear syntax, and to produce native binaries rather than relying on a downloadable runtime. It’s a general-purpose, language with a source-to-source compiler (to C99), and a portable SDK, readily available bindings for quite a few C libraries, a flexible module system, testing facilities and a set of utilities to make one’s life easier."

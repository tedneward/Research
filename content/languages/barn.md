title=Barn
tags=language
summary=Barn is a simple programming language written in GoLang and compiled to C++. Syntax is very simple, and Barn can call C/C++ functions natively so creating new bindings should be easy. Barn was written with the goal of being as fast and easy to use as possible. Barn is just a little project with which I can chill and just code.

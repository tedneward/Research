Katahdin employs the theory of parsing expression grammars and packrat parsing. Unlike other contemporary work, Katahdin applies these techniques at runtime to allow the grammar to be modified by a running program. New constructs such as expressions and statements can be defined, or a new language can be implemented from scratch. It is built as an interpreter on the Mono implementation of the .NET framework.

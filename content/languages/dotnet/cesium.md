> Cesium compiles standard C source code to a .NET assembly. No unmanaged/mixed mode (a-lÃ¡ C++/CLI) code is generated; everything is fully managed (but may be unsafe). C programs are very useful in the modern world, and solve practical tasks. At the same time, deploying C code alongside .NET code may be tricky (especially if your application supports multiple platforms). Cesium is designed to resolve the problems of C code deployment, and lift it to the managed state (so it is cross-platform in the same way the underlying CIL code it is compiled to).

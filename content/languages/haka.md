[Website](http://www.haka-security.org/) | [Source](https://github.com/haka-security/haka) | [LiveCD ISO](http://static.arkoon.net/haka/haka-live_0.2.2_i386.iso) | [Reference manual](http://doc.haka-security.org/haka/release/v0.3.0/doc/ref/refindex.html)

The scope of Haka language is twofold. First of all, it allows to write security rules in order to filter/alter/drop unwanted packets and log and report malicious activities. Second, Haka features a grammar enabling to specify network protocols and their underlying state machine.

The overall goal of Haka is to abstract low-level stuff like memory management and packet reassembly to non developer experts and to provide an easy way to analyze quickly new network protocols.

title=OpenComal
tags=language
summary=OpenComal is a portable and free implementation of the Comal programming language written by moi. Currently supported platforms are Unix, MsDos and Win32 (95, 98, NT, 2000, XP and whatever they come up with next :-) Comal is a crossover between Basic and Pascal, with the best features of both and none of the drawbacks of either.

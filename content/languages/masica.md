title=MASICA
tags=language
summary=An educational interactive TinyBASIC interpreter targeting MakoVM, an extremely simple stack-based virtual machine intended for the creation of video games. MASICA is designed to provide an absolute minimum of features and complexity while including what is necessary to illustrate core imperative programming concepts such as variables, iteration and conditional branches. Variable names are single letters. The MASICA interface is similar to that of early 8-bit microcomputers- a prompt which can evaluate commands immediately or store a sequence of commands prefixed with line numbers. Several commands for removing or editing existing lines are also provided.

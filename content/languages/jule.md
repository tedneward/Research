Simple and safe programming language with built-in concurrency, first-class C/C++ interoperability and powerful compile-time capabilities.

### Key Features

- Optimized for building fast, safe, and reliable software
- Powerful compile-time system: reflection, evaluation, iterations, and more
- Deterministic memory management with reference counting and smart pointers
- Safety by default: immutability, bounds checking, no uninitialized memory, no variable shadowing
- Built-in testing framework
- Easy and efficient low-level development
- [Cross compilation](https://manual.jule.dev/compiler/cross-compilation) made simple: standard library support, target-specific IR generation, and architecture imitation
- Lightweight error handling with [exceptionals](https://manual.jule.dev/error-handling/exceptionals), similar to optional types
- Built-in [concurrency](https://manual.jule.dev/concurrency): async runtime and coroutines, channels, mutexes, condition variables, and more
- High [interoperability](https://manual.jule.dev/integrated-jule/interoperability) with C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++
- C++ [API](https://manual.jule.dev/api) for extending Jule or integrating with existing codebases

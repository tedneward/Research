### Implementations

* [Pascal Script](http://www.remobjects.com/ps.aspx): Statically typed. Implements "most of Object Pascal". Can't define new classes.
* [Inno Pascal](https://github.com/smle/inno-pascal) : Inno Pascal is a simple Pascal compiler for Win32. It produces compact, native-code x86 executables without requiring any external assemblers or linkers. It was written entirely from scratch; it is not based on any other existing compilers. Full source code is included under the GPL license.
* [Dev-Pascal](http://www.bloodshed.net/devpascal.html) : Free IDE and compiler for Pascal (with Free Pascal).
* [CoPascal](http://www.bloodshed.net/delphi/copascal.zip) : Co-Pascal is an extension of the Pascal-S compiler developed by N. Wirth. Pascal source code included.
* [TinyPascal](http://www.bloodshed.net/delphi/tinypas.zip) : A small implementation of the Pascal language. Full Delphi sources included.
* [Free Pascal](http://www.freepascal.org/) : 32-bit Pascal compiler for Dos, Linux, OS/2. Pascal source code included. Used in Dev-Pascal.
* [Virtual Pascal](http://vpascal.ning.com/) : A tool of choice for 32-bit cross-platform development using the Pascal language. It is compatible with Borland Pascal and Delphi, including the Run-Time Library (RTL), an optimizing compiler, a powerful integrated debugger, and comprehensive online documentation.

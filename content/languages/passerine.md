"Passerine has roots in Scheme and ML-flavored languages: it's the culmination of everything I expect from a programming language, including the desire to keep everything as minimalistic and concise as possible. At its core, Passerine is lambda-calculus with pattern-matching, structural types, fiber-based concurrency, and syntactic extension."

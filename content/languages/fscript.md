summary=An extremely simple scripting language.

[Source](https://fscript.sourceforge.net/)

Its intended use is as an embedded language in other Java programs. It is very simple to embed - it can be as simple as sub-classing one class to add your own functionality. However is not a complete programming language, as it has no library of standard functions (such as IO and string processing). FScript supplies a base functionality (such as flow control, variable handling and basic math operations) that can extended by the host application.

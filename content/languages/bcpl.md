summary=BCPL ("Basic Combined Programming Language") is a procedural, imperative, and structured programming language. A stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL, called B, was the language on which the C programming language was based. BCPL introduced several features of many modern programming languages, including using curly braces to delimit code blocks.

Tycho is a new programming language designed for language oriented programming (LOP). Combined with a very dynamic runtime, Tycho programmers can define syntax and semantics that bring the code closer to the problem domain.

At its heart, it's a dynamically typed language that runs on the .Net Framework. It's object oriented but requires no classes. Aspect orientation is achieved with actors (see the example below for a laziness aspect.) Software transactional memory in tycho is, too, an aspect, and makes for a pretty good "free" concurrency. Program consistency is supported with schemas that check validity of objects at runtime, not to mention provide functional programming style pattern matching for just about anything. Macros can be used to augment the language's syntax, and whole new languages can be created too.

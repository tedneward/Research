From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx):
> Rexx is used as a scripting and macro language, and is often used for processing data and text and generating reports; these similarities with Perl mean that Rexx works well in Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programming and it is indeed used for this purpose. Rexx is the primary scripting language in some operating systems, e.g. OS/2, MVS, VM, AmigaOS, and is also used as an internal macro language in some other software, such as SPFPC, KEDIT, THE and the ZOC terminal emulator. Additionally, the Rexx language can be used for scripting and macros in any program that uses Windows Scripting Host ActiveX scripting engines languages (e.g. VBScript and JScript) if one of the Rexx engines is installed.

### Implementations

* JVM: [NetRexx](http://www.netrexx.org/)
* C++: [ooRexx](http://www.oorexx.org/)

Rexx is a structured, high-level programming language designed for ease of learning and reading. It was developed at IBM by Mike Cowlishaw. Rexx is a full language that can be used as a scripting, macro language, and application development language. It is often used for processing data and text and generating reports. Rexx is the primary scripting language in some operating systems, e.g. OS/2, MVS, VM, AmigaOS, and is also used as an internal macro language in some other software, such as SPF/PC, KEDIT, THE and the ZOC terminal emulator. Additionally, the Rexx language can be used for scripting and macros in any program that uses Windows Scripting Host ActiveX scripting engines languages (e.g. VBScript and JScript) if one of the Rexx engines is installed.

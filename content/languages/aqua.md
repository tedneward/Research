summary=An open-source language for distributed workflow coordination in p2p networks; Aqua programs are executed on many peers, sequentially or in parallel, forming a single-use coordination network. Applications are turned into hostless workflows over distributed function calls, which enables various levels of decentralization: from handling by a limited set of servers to complete peer-to-peer architecture by connecting user devices directly.

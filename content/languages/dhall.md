[Website](https://dhall-lang.org/)

 Not Turing-complete. Untrusted code: can't access the file system, can fetch Dhall libraries over HTTP(S) from static URLs (but libraries aren't allowed to access your data), can use up memory and CPU time for a DoS attack. Has a work-in-progress Clojure and Ruby implementation.

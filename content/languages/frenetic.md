The languages used to program networks today lack modern features. Programming them is a complicated and error-prone task, and outages and infiltrations are frequent. Frenetic is an open-source Software Defined Network (SDN) controller platform designed to make SDN programming easy, modular, and semantically correct, based on programming languages with the following essential features:

* High-level abstractions that give programmers direct control over the network, allowing them to specify what they want the network to do without worrying about how to implement it.
* Modular constructs that facilitate compositional reasoning about programs.
* Portability, allowing programs written for one platform to be reused with different devices.
* Rigorous semantic foundations that precisely document the meaning of the language and provide a solid platform for mechanical program analysis tools.

You can build Frenetic-based network applications with:

* OCaml
* Python
* REST and JSON (i.e., any programming language!)

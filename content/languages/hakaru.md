Probabilistic programming systems allow us to write programs which describe probability distributions, and provide mechanisms to sample and condition the distributions they represent on data. In this page, we give a sense of the sorts of problems Hakaru is great at solving, and how you would describe them in Hakaru.

Transpiles to Haskell or C.

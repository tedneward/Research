[Standard ML](http://sml-family.org/) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML)) and its implementations:

Implementations:

* [SML/NJ](http://smlnj.org/), an implementation with extensions for concurrent programming developed at Princeton University and Bell Laboratories
* [Moscow ML](http://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/mosml.html), a lightweight implementation of Standard ML
* [Alice ML](http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/alice), an extension of Standard ML with support for parallel programming using futures
* [MLton](https://github.com/MLton/mlton), a powerful whole-program optimizing compiler strictly conforming to the Definition
* [SML.NET](../dotnet/smlnet), a compiler for Standard ML on the CLR
* [PolyML](https://www.polyml.org/) ([Source](https://github.com/polyml))
* [ConcurrentML](http://mlton.org/ConcurrentML)

Dependent ML, an extension of ML with dependent typing that led to the development of:
* [ATS](../ats)

[Lazy ML](https://users.monash.edu.au/~lloyd/tildeFP/LML/), an experimental lazily evaluated ML dialect from the early 1980s

[PAL (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL_(programming_language)), an educational language related to ML (the Pedagogic Algorithmic Language, is a programming language developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in around 1967 to help teach programming language semantics and design.[1][2] It is a "direct descendant" of ISWIM and owes much of its philosophy to Christopher Strachey)

Inspired [OCaml](../ocaml), [F#](../dotnet/fsharp)

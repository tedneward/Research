summary=An (unpure) functional language whose concept of environment is not implicit as in traditional languages, but made available explicitly as a first class value.

This results in a semantics for environments that is best known from the object oriented paradigm, and gives us a united function/class concept in a very orthogonal way. We also look at the language as a real-world general purpose language, considering semantics (of type-inference, for example), implementation issues, and practical experience in using the compiler.

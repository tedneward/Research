DWScript is an object-oriented Delphi scripting language for Delphi; also supports syntax and features similar to Prism and FreePascal, as well as various language extensions. Scripts can be executed from Delphi applications (in a safe, sand-boxed fashion), you can also compile and execute them with JavaScript-capable engine using Smart Mobile Studio. An experimental JIT compiler is available for Win32.

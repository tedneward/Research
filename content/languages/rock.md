summary=Little language made with Rust and LLVM.

[Source](https://github.com/Champii/Rock)

Aim to follow the enforced safeness of the Rust model with a borrow checker (SoonT) and achieve high native performances thanks to LLVM. Rock is highly inspired from Livescript and Rust, and will also borrow (pun intended) some features from Crystal, from functional languages like Haskell, and even from Rust itself.

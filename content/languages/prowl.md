title=Prowl
tags=language
summary=A statically-typed stack-based programming language that draws from a wide range of inspirations, mainly functional, logic, and stack-based languages. 
~~~~~~

However, the language is unique with its powerful program combinator system. Prowl exploits a homomorphism between string concatenation and concatenative languages that allows regex to be used as a computational and mental model for control flow. This model provides a rigid framework to solve combinatory and constraint problems (in addition to general purpose programming) yet retains performant translations into DFAs due to the regex base. With stacks for data and regex for control flow, Prowl provides a unique but ergonomic way to think about hard problems.

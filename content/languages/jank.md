"Where jank differs from Clojure JVM is that its host is C++ on top of an LLVM-based JIT. This allows jank to offer the same benefits of REPL-based development while being able to seamlessly reach into the native world and compete seriously with JVM's performance. Still, jank is a Clojure dialect and thus includes its code-as-data philosophy and powerful macro system. jank remains a functional-first language which builds upon Clojure's rich set of persistent, immutable data structures. When mutability is needed, jank offers a software transaction memory and reactive agent system to ensure clean and correct multi-threaded designs."

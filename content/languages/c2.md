summary=Evolution of C.
~~~~~~

[Website](http://c2lang.org/index.html) | [Source](https://github.com/c2lang/c2compiler)

The C2 project attempts to create a new language, strongly based on C. In a nutshell, the main differences with C are:

* Higher development speed
* Same/better speed of execution
* Better compilation times
* Integrated build system
* Stricter syntax (easier for tooling)
* Great tooling (formatting tool, graphical refactoring tool)
* Easy integration with C libraries
* Should be easy to learn for C programmers
* Should help to avoid common mistakes

As C2 is an evolution of C, it also has explicit non goals:

* higher-level features (like object-orientation, garbage collection, etc.)
* to be a completely new language

## Example
Hello world:
```
module hello_world;

import stdio as io;

fn i32 main(i32 argc, char** argv) {
    io.printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

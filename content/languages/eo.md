title=EO (Elegant Objects)
tags=language, object-oriented
summary=An object-oriented language, to prove to ourselves that true object-oriented programming is practically possible. Not just in books and abstract examples, but in real code that works. That's why EO is being createdâ€”to put all that "crazy" pure object-oriented ideas into practice and see whether they can work.

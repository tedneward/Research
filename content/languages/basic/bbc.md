Up to 4 Gbytes of memory (256 Megabytes in 32-bit editions and 32 Mbytes in the in-browser edition) is provided for the user's program, data and stack (subject to sufficient RAM being available). Unlike some older versions of BASIC, you won't suffer the frustration of running out of memory! Line numbers are optional.

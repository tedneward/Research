summary=A C-like language trying to be "an incremental improvement over C" rather than a whole new language.

C3 is a programming language that builds on the syntax and semantics of the C language, with the goal of evolving it while still retaining familiarity for C programmers.

It's an evolution, not a revolution: the C-like for programmers who like C.

Design Principles

* Procedural "get things done"-type of language.
* Try to stay close to C - only change what's really necessary.
* C ABI compatibility and excellent C integration.
* Learning C3 should be easy for a C programmer.
* Data is inert.
* Avoid "big ideas" & the "more is better" fallacy.
* Introduce some higher level conveniences where the value is great.

C3 owes its inspiration to the [C2](../c2) language: to iterate on top of C without trying to be a whole new language.

In what ways does C3 differ from C?

* No mandatory header files
* New semantic macro system
* Module based name spacing
* Subarrays (slices)
* Compile time reflection
* Enhanced compile time execution
* Generics based on generic modules
* "Result"-based zero overhead error handling
* Defer
* Value methods
* Associated enum data
* No preprocessor
* Less undefined behaviour and added runtime checks in "safe" mode
* Limited operator overloading to enable userland dynamic arrays
* Optional pre and post conditions

Tokay is a programming language to quickly implement solutions for text processing problems. This can either be just simple data extractions, but also parsing entire structures or parts of it, and turning information into structured parse trees or abstract syntax trees for further processing. Therefore, Tokay is both a tool and language for simple one-liners, but can also be used to implement code-analyzers, refactoring tools, interpreters, compilers or transpilers. Actually Tokay's own language parser is implemented in Tokay itself.

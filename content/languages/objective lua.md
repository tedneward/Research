title=Objective Lua
tags=language
summary=Objective Lua is an almost pure superset of Lua that welds the Objective C object orientation system and syntax on top of the classic Lua language. It is written entirely in Lua and works by translating Objective Lua code into Lua code as it is loaded. This means that it's incredibly portable and incredibly fast.

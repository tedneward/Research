title=Bite
tags=language
summary=Bite is a dynamically typed, object oriented programming language. Dynamically typed, because the type of the content of a variable can change during runtime of the program. Object-oriented, because you can define classes to encapsulate your code and data. Bite uses modules, classes and functions to separate code.

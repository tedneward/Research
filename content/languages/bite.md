Dynamically typed, because the type of the content of a variable can change during runtime of the program. Object-oriented, because you can define classes to encapsulate your code and data. Bite uses modules, classes and functions to separate code.

Bite compiles to a bytecode that is run on a virtual machine.

The reference virtual machine, BiteVM, is a stack-based virtual machine written in C#.

summary=GAML is an agent-oriented language dedicated to the definition of agent-based simulations. It takes its roots in object-oriented languages like Java or Smalltalk, but extends the object-oriented programming approach with powerful concepts (like skills, declarative definitions or agent migration) to allow for a better expressivity in models.

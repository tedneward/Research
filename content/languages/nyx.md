nyx is yet another a dynamically typed scripting language with flexible syntax and strict type system. Its syntax resembles Python,Java and C family languages. We can seemlessly wirte code after skimming language reference manual if you've already familiar with any other popular languages. Moreover, nyx attempts to detect sorts of erroneous program forms at compile time that benefitted from its underlying strict type system, this could tremendously save your time for debugging those type relevant bugs.

Implemented in C++.

Pixie is a lightweight lisp suitable for both general use as well as shell scripting. The language is still in a "pre-alpha" phase and as such changes fairly quickly. The standard library is heavily inspired by Clojure as well as several other functional programming languages. It is written in RPython (http://pypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/coding-guide.html) and as such supports a fairly fast GC and an amazingly fast tracing JIT.

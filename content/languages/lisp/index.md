### Common Lisp Implementations:

* [Common Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org/): A dialect of the Lisp programming language, published in ANSI standard document ANSI INCITS 226-1994. Common Lisp is not an implementation, but rather a language specification. Several implementations of the Common Lisp standard are available, including free and open-source software and proprietary products. Common Lisp is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. It supports a combination of procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms.
* [Allegro Common Lisp](https://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/): Commercial implementation with a free (evaluational, not-timeboxed) download.
* [CLISP](https://clisp.sourceforge.io/): a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented, dynamic, functional programming language.
* [Clozure CL](https://www.clozure.com/ccl): "Clozure CL is available for download from [ccl.clozure.com](http://ccl.clozure.com/)" (Self-hosted compiler, so requires a copy of both the source and bootstrap compilers, which are all available on [Github](https://github.com/Clozure/ccl): "For the latest released version of CCL, please see https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/latest and download the archive for your platform. These archives contain not only the necessary binaries, but also a full clone of the source code. So, to install a complete CCL, all you have to do is download one archive and extract it.")

### Deployment

[Running Lisp in production](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/engineering/running-lisp-in-production/)

### [Awesome-lisp-languages](https://github.com/dundalek/awesome-lisp-languages)

## Classification

- **Type-A**: Simple syntax mapping  
*These languages usually just provide s-expressions (parentheses) syntax and are translated to the target language without extra features/semantics. Also sometimes being called transpilers.*

- **Type-B**: Syntax and additional semantics  
*In addition to translating the syntax some additional features/semantics that are not present in the target language are added. Usually if a language does not fit in other category, it can be considered being a Type-B.*

- **Type-C**: [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)-like  
*Distintive syntax that besides parentheses also uses brackets and curly braces. Distinctive features are persistent data structures, namespaces and vars, protocols.*

- **Type-L**: [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp)  
*Implementing ANSI Common Lisp standard or being inspired by it.*

- **Type-S**: [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29)  
*Implementing some of RxRS standards or being inspired by Scheme.*

## Languages

Listed primarily by the language which can be used for interoperability / [FFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface).

*Language section does not necessarily mean the language of the implementation. For example `Ferret` compiles into `C++` but the compiler is written in `Clojure`. Or `Carp` interops with `C` but it is mostly written in `Haskell`. In case of `SBCL` it contains only small amounts of `C`, but it is implemented almost entirely in `Common Lisp`.*

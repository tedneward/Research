Common Lisp Implementations:
* [JVM: Armed Bear Common Lisp](http://abcl.org/)
* [SBCL: Steel Bank Common Lisp](http://www.sbcl.org/) ([Source](http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html))
* [Lisp in a Box!](https://common-lisp.net/project/lispbox/): "Lispbox is an IDE for Common Lisp development. Actually, Lispbox is just a pre-configured packaging of the Emacs editing environment, SLIME (The Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs), the Quicklisp library manager, and the Clozure Common Lisp compiler."
* [Clozure CL](https://www.clozure.com/ccl): "Clozure CL is available for download from [ccl.clozure.com](http://ccl.clozure.com/)" (Self-hosted compiler, so requires a copy of both the source and bootstrap compilers, which are all available on [Github](https://github.com/Clozure/ccl): "For the latest released version of CCL, please see https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/latest and download the archive for your platform. These archives contain not only the necessary binaries, but also a full clone of the source code. So, to install a complete CCL, all you have to do is download one archive and extract it.")
* [Allegro Common Lisp](https://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/): Commercial implementation with a free (evaluational, not-timeboxed) download.

Lisp-inspired:
* [Arc](../arc)
* [Io](../../io)
* [CLiPs](../clips): an expert system rule engine using a Lisp as the language for facts and rules
* [JESS](https://jess.sandia.gov/): Java Expert System Shell, a CLIPS-inspired expert system rule engine on the JVM
* [Arkscript](../arkscript)
* [Carp](../carp)

"A Lisp":
* [Ferret](https://ferret-lang.org/): appears to compile [Clojure](/languages/clojure.html) into native code
* [Clojure](../clojure): a Lisp on the JVM

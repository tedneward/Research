Language features: 

* Lisp style Macro support 
* Lambdas 
* Tail recursion 
* Big integers

Host features: 

* .NET integration , interact with .NET objects or external .NET resources 
* Single step debugging 
* Custom call stack 

DSLisp is intended for two different purposes: 

* To act as a Lisp inspired scripting language with full .NET support. 
* To let custom Doman Specific Languages "compile" into the DSLisp AST. And thus run your own DSL ontop of the DSLisp AST, with debugging and reflection support.

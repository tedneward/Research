title=PicoLisp
tags=language
summary=PicoLisp is a programming language, a dialect of the language Lisp. Its most prominent features are simplicity and minimalism. It is built on one internal data type: a cell. On the language level, a programmer can use three different data types (numbers, symbols, and lists) being represented by cells and differentiated by bits at the end of the cell.

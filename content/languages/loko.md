title=Loko
tags=language
summary=Loko is an interactive interpreter for the Logo programming language targeting MakoVM, an extremely simple stack-based virtual machine intended for the creation of video games. Logo is best known for beginner-oriented "Turtle Graphics" functionality, but internally the language is actually a dynamically-scoped member of the Lisp family. As such, Logo provides sophisticated list manipulation facilities and support for higher-order functions.

title=cola
tags=language, object, functional
summary=An ongoing project to create a springboard for investigating new computing paradigms. Everything in it is late-bound, the intention being that any paradigm (existing or yet to be invented, formal complexity notwithstanding) be easily and efficiently mapped to it and made available to the user.

Last update appears to be 2007 but some interesting ideas appear to be buried here:

> There is some (often slightly stale, or at the very least incomplete) documentation available for: the id-based [object language](https://www.piumarta.com/software/cola/pepsi.html); the 'pre-scheme'-like [function language](https://www.piumarta.com/software/cola/coke.html); the theory of how the two complement and complete each other as a [COLA](https://www.piumarta.com/software/cola/colas-whitepaper.pdf); the id [object model](https://www.piumarta.com/software/cola/objmodel2.pdf) on which it is all based; a trivial extension that adds support for [Leiberman prototypes](https://www.piumarta.com/software/cola/prototypes.html) to the id object model; an evolving device-independent [canvas abstraction](https://www.piumarta.com/software/cola/canvas.pdf) and its superjacent UI model.

As of 5 Oct 2020, download still works--should grab and explore.

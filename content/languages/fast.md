title=FAST
tags=language
summary=FAST is a new programming language, which combines the advantages of other programming languages: FAST supports functions as data types FAST is fully object-oriented and knows multiple inheritance FAST has dynamical memory management and garbage collection FAST includes library units on its own FAST speaks Assembler FAST knows macros FAST has a clear and consequent syntax FAST compiles within tenths of seconds and creates efficient code FAST has lots of useful features such as e.g. the prevention of the Division by Zero error. FAST programs are written as plain text and then sent thru the FAST compiler. Small and efficient code is created and a COM-File results. Up to now, FAST only compiles for MS-DOS (I just have not yet found out how to assemble a binary executable for WINDOWS).

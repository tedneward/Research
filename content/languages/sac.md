summary=Single-Assignment C is an array programming language predominantly suited for application areas such as numerically intensive applications and signal processing. Its distinctive feature is that it combines high-level program specifications with runtime efficiency similar to that of hand-optimized low-level specifications. Key to the optimization process that facilitates these runtimes is the underlying functional model which also constitutes the basis for implicit parallelisation. This makes SAC ideally suited for harnessing the full potential of a wide variety of modern architectures ranging from a few symmetric cores with shared memory to massively parallel systems that host heterogeneous components including GPUs and FPGAs.

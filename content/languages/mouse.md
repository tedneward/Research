There are three dialects of Mouse described here:

* Mouse-79 - The original dialect described in Byte Magazine in 1979.
* Mouse-83 - The version described in Grogono's 1983 book, Mouse: A Language for Microcomputers. This version has some different syntax than the 1979 version, but the language is otherwise very similar.
* Mouse-2002 - This is a new version I've recently developed. It's based on Mouse-83, and includes numerous extensions: floating-point support, arrays, file I/O, etc.

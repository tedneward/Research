summary=ToonTalk is an interpreter for a concurrent constraint programming language. Concurrent constraint programming is a synthesis of concurrent logic programming and constraint logic programming. (See, for example, Saraswat). The class of languages for which programs are roughly interchangeable with ToonTalk programs include Oz, E-Lang, Janus, Flat Guarded Horn Clauses, KL1/KLIC, Flat Concurrent Prolog, Parlog, and Strand. The syntax of all these languages is textual while ToonTalk has an action-oriented video game animation syntax. The programming environment is completely different as well. In ToonTalk, the process of constructing, testing, and debugging programs closely resembles playing a video game. "From Prolog and Zelda to ToonTalk" is a paper discussing these ideas in detail.

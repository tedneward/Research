summary=A domain-specific language to define and control hardware behaviour. 
~~~~~~

It is intended to run on embedded systems which are connected to motor controllers, sensors etc. Most of the time it is used in combination with a higher level engine like ROS or RoSys. You can think of the microcontroller as the machine's lizard brain which ensures basic safety and performs all time-critical actions.

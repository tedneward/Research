Fantom uses a flexible typing system; all variables are statically typed but can also take on the feel of a dynamically typed language through dynamic calls and automatic downcasting.Fantom rejects generic types due to their complexity, but it does have a set of built-in generic types: List, Map, and Func. Fantom has an easy to use reflection API and metaprogramming capabilities.

Fantom is a portable language that runs on the JVM and modern web browsers. It features a familiar Java-like syntax, static (and dynamic) typing, elegant system library, closures, immutability, actor concurrency, and much more.

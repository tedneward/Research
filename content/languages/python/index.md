* Web: [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/): installable locally via `pip install notebook`
* Web: [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/): "latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data ... allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning... extensions expand and enrich functionality."

Not sure if this is a library or an implementation or a tool, it's sort of all three: [VPython](https://vpython.org/), 3D Programming for Ordinary Mortals

### Interesting examples:
* [Peter Norvig's Collection of Jupyter Notebooks](http://www.norvig.com/ipython/README.html): This makes me consider spending some time with Jupyter Notebooks a lot more.

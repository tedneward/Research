"Pyodide brings the Python 3.9 runtime to the browser via WebAssembly, thanks to Emscripten. It builds the Python scientific stack including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and scikit-learn. Over 75 packages are currently available. In addition, itâ€™s possible to install pure Python wheels from PyPI. Pyodide provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and Python. When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs."

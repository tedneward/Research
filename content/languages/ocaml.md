### What is Caml?
Caml is a general-purpose programming language, designed with program safety and reliability in mind. It is very expressive, yet easy to learn and use. Caml supports functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming styles. It has been developed and distributed by INRIA, a French research institute in computer science and applied mathematics, since 1985.

### OCaml
The OCaml system is the main implementation of the Caml language. It features a powerful module system and a full-fledged object-oriented layer. It comes with a native-code compiler that supports numerous architectures, for high performance; a bytecode compiler, for increased portability; and an interactive loop, for experimentation and rapid development.

### Caml Light
The Caml Light system is an older, lightweight implementation of the core Caml language. It is obsolete, no longer actively maintained, and will be removed eventually. We recommend switching immediately to its successor, OCaml.

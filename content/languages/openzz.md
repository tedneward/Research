title=OpenZz
tags=language
summary=OpenZz is an interpreted dynamic parser which is well suited to rapid development of parsing solutions, starting from rapid language prototyping to full fledged compilers. OpenZz is a dynamic LALR(1) parser which allows its grammar to be modified and extended by commands written in its own language as well as through functionality provided by external libraries. OpenZz is implemented as a C library and exports C-bindings, so it can be joined with other code libraries both by static linking and runtime module loading. OpenZz is being developed by the INFN for use in the compilation chain of the APE("ah-pei") series of highly parallel processing computers. APE systems are developed for performing LQCD physics research.

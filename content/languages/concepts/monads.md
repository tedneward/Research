[Monads for functional programming](./Monads_for_functional_programming.pdf): Wadler's original paper on monads. Key line: "Pure functional languages have this advantage: all flow of data is made explicit. And this disadvantage: sometimes it is painfully explicit."

[Monads are hard because...](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2014/03/03/monads-are-hard-because/): "Monads are hard because there are so many bad monad tutorials getting in the way of finally finding Wadlerâ€™s nice paper."

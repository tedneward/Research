Pure-functional languages are those that have no side effects permitted (except under very specific circumstances, to allow for things like I/O to happen). Impure functional languages allow state modification to happen (under constraints) and thus often avoid the gyrations to which pure functional languages need to go, such as [monads](monads.html).

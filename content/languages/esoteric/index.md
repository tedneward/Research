[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) is more generous in its description:
> An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke. The use of esoteric distinguishes these languages from programming languages that working developers use to write software. Usually, an esolang's creators do not intend the language to be used for mainstream programming, although some esoteric features, such as visuospatial syntax,[1] have inspired practical applications in the arts. Such languages are often popular among hackers and hobbyists.

[Esolangs wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page): With lovely languages like:

* [Thue](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Thue) is an esoteric programming language based around the idea of a "semi-Thue system": a system which specifies strings that can be rewritten to certain other strings; a program is simply a list of search strings, and possible replacements for them. As a nondeterministic language, a program has the potential to halt if there is some way to reach an end state via applying replacements, even if rules such as "always apply the first replacement" would lead to an infinite loop. ...
* [Funciton](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Funciton) is a two-dimensional, minimalistic, declarative programming language invented in 2011. (ASCII call-flow graphs FTW!)
* [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck), the classic esolang.
* [Emmental](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Emmental) is a self-modifying language. It is defined by a meta-circular interpreter (an Emmental interpreter described in Emmental.) The meta-circular interpreter provides an operation which modifies operations of the meta-circular interpreter. Emmental is a stack-based language, but it also has a queue.
* [FIFTH](https://esolangs.org/wiki/FIFTH): for all those functional alcoholics out there.
* [LifeScript](https://esolangs.org/wiki/LifeScript): Typical LifeScript is basically a text document, looking like source code, which describes the actual activity of the editor.
* [SARTRE](https://esolangs.org/wiki/SARTRE): an extremely unstructured language. Statements in SARTRE have no purpose; they just are there. Thus, SARTRE programs are left to define their own functions. SARTRE programmers tend to be boring and depressed and are no fun at parties.

... and [many, many others](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list). The Esolangs wiki has broken them out into a number of different [categories](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esolang:Categorization), which is interesting even for non-esoteric languages.

Some random links I've found:

* [Beyond Ada: The First Paranoid Programming Language](http://zzo38computer.org/backup/paranoid-programming-language.html)
* [BIT](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/bit.html): a programming language built around individual bits
* [foogol](http://www.bertnase.de/html/foogol.html): A (vax) compiler for a tiny ALGOL-like language
* [JSFuck](http://www.jsfuck.com/): an esoteric and educational programming style based on the atomic parts of JavaScript. It uses only six different characters to write and execute code.
* [Q-BAL](https://mirrors.talideon.com/articles/qbal/): a programming language based on the question “What would it be like if a language were based on queues rather than stacks?” The acronym stands for Queue-BAsed Lanugage. This language is not designed to be useful, just fun.
* There's some languages--hard to tell if they're serious or not--at [p-and-q.com](http://p-nand-q.com/programming/languages/index.html).

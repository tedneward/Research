title=Unlambda
tags=language, esolang, functional
summary=A programming language. Nothing remarkable there. The originality of Unlambda is that it stands as the unexpected intersection of two marginal families of languages: functional programming languages (like Scheme) and obfuscated programming languages (like Intercal). Unlambda uses a functional approach to programming: the only form of objects it manipulates are functions. Each function takes a function as argument and returns a function.

There is a specification which currently rests at [1.2](https://github.com/justinmeza/lolcode-spec/blob/master/v1.2/lolcode-spec-v1.2.md) ([local copy](../specification-1.2)). If you can believe that.

```
HAI 1.2
  CAN HAS STDIO?
  VISIBLE "HAI WORLD!!!1!"
KTHXBYE
```

There used to be Java and CLR versions; no idea if they still exist.

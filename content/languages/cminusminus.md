## Implementations

* [QuickC--](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/c--/qc--.html): A ``portable assembly language'' that can replace C as a target language used by compiler writers. The goal of the Quick C-- project is to test those ideas in an implementation. Quick C-- is a relatively small compiler with a few simple optimizations. Our primary goal is to to validate our design experimentally. A secondary, but still significant goal is to provide a vehicle for experimenting with new techniques for building retargetable compilers.

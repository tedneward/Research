summary=A self-hosted Ada-inspired programming language for very small systems. Cowgol is an experimental, Ada-inspired language for very small systems (6502, Z80, etc). It's different because it's intended to be self-hosted on these devices: the end goal is to be able to rebuild the entire compiler on an 8-bit micro, although we're not there yet.

title=execline

summary=execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh - but its syntax is quite different from a traditional shell syntax. The execlineb program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text file; the other commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb script. execline is as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops, getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile, its syntax is far more logical and predictable than the shell's syntax, and has no security issues.

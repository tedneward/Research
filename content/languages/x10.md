title=X10
tags=language, concurrency
summary=A statically-typed object-oriented language, extending a sequential core language with places, activities, clocks, (distributed, multi-dimensional) arrays and struct types; all this is motivated by the desire to use the new language for high-end, high-performance, high-productivity computing.

> X10 is a class-based, strongly-typed, garbage-collected, object-oriented language. To support concurrency and distribution, X10 uses the Asynchronous Partitioned Global Address Space programming model (APGAS). This model introduces two key concepts -- places and asynchronous tasks -- and a few mechanisms for coordination. With these, APGAS can express both regular and irregular parallelism, message-passing-style and active-message-style computations, fork-join and bulk-synchronous parallelism. In contrast to hybrid models like MPI+OpenMP, the same constructs underpin both intra- and inter-place concurrency.

> Both its modern, type-safe sequential core and simple programming model for concurrency and distribution contribute to making X10 a high-productivity language in the HPC and Big Data spaces. User productivity is further enhanced by providing tools such as an Eclipse-based IDE (X10DT). Implementations of X10 are available for a wide variety of hardware and software platforms ranging from laptops, to commodity clusters, to supercomputers.

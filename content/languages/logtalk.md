tags=language, logic
summary=A declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.
~~~~~~

As a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for modules, prototypes, classes, protocols (interfaces), categories (components and hot patching), event-driven programming, and high-level multi-threading programming. Distributed under a commercial friendly license, it includes full documentation, portable libraries, portable developer tools, and a large number of programming examples to help get you started.

Implemented as a trans-compiler in highly portable, extensively tested, and well documented code, it can use most modern and standards compliant Prolog implementations as a backend compiler.

title=Tamsin
tags=language
summary=Tamsin is an oddball little language that can't decide if it's a meta-language, a programming language, or a rubbish lister. Its primary goal is to allow the rapid development of parsers, static analyzers, interpreters, and compilers, and to allow them to be expressed compactly. Golf your grammar! (Or write it like a decent human being, if you must.)

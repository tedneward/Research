Features:

* Futures: laziness and light-weight concurrency with implicit data-flow synchronisation
* Higher-order modules: higher-order functors and abstract signatures
* Packages: integrating static with dynamic typing and first class modules
* Pickling: higher-order type-safe, generic & platform-independent persistence
* Components: platform-independence and type-safe dynamic import & export of modules
* Distribution: type-safe cross-platform remote functions and network mobility
* Constraints: solving combinatorical problems using constraint propagation and programmable search

The Alice System is a rich open-source programming system featuring the following tools:

* Virtual machine: a portable VM with support for just-in-time compilation
* Interactive system: an interpreter-like interactive toplevel with easy graphical interface
* Batch compiler: separate compilation
* Static linker: type-safe bundling of components
* Inspector: a tool for interactively inspecting data structures
* Explorer: a tool for interactively investigating search problems
* Gtk+: a binding for the Gnome toolkit GUI library
* SQL: a library for accessing SQL databases
* XML: a simple library for parsing XML documents

summary=Extended ML (EML) is a framework for specification and formal development of Standard ML (SML) programs. EML specifications look just like SML programs except that axioms are allowed in signatures and in place of code in structures and functors. Some EML specifications are executable, since SML function definitions are just axioms of a certain special form. This makes EML a "wide-spectrum" language which can be used to express every stage in the development of a SML program from the initial high-level specification to the final program itself and including intermediate stages in which specification and program are intermingled.

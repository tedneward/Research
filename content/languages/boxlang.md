BoxLang has been designed to be a highly adaptable and dynamic language to take advantage of all the modern features of the JVM and was designed with several goals in mind:

* Be a rapid application development (RAD) scripting language and middleware.
* Unstagnate the dynamic language ecosystem in Java.
* Be dynamic, modular, lightweight, and fast.
* Be 100% interoperable with Java.
* Be modern, functional, and fluent (Think mixing CFML, Node, Kotlin, Java, and Clojure)
* Be able to support multiple runtimes and deployment targets:

    * Native OS Binaries (CLI Tooling, compilers, etc.)
    * MiniServer
    * Servlet Containers - CommandBox/Tomcat/Jetty/JBoss
    * JSR223 Scripting Engines
    * AWS Lambda
    * Microsoft Azure Functions (Coming Soon)
    * Android/iOS Devices (Coming Soon)
    * Web assembly (Coming Soon)

* Compile down to Java ByteCode
* Allow backward compatibility with the existing ColdFusion/CFML language.
* Great IDE, Debugger and Tooling: https://boxlang.ortusbooks.com/getting-started/ide-tooling
* Scripting (Any OS and Shebang) and REPL capabilities

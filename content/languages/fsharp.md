"F# is a mature, open source, cross-platform, functional-first programming language. It empowers users and organizations to tackle complex computing problems with simple, maintainable and robust code."

Originally from [Microsoft Research](/places/msr.html).

F# was originally a CLR-based variant of [OCaml](/languages/ocaml.html). Since F# 3.0, it has relaxed some of the direct compatibility with OCaml in favor of a friendlier syntax, but still very much holds to its roots.

#### Areas of use
[Cloud](https://fsharp.org/guides/cloud/): Cloud and SOA are places where F# has made some strong plays. 

[Web](https://fsharp.org/guides/web): There's a collection of different web frameworks for F#. Some are more recent than others.

[Mobile](https://fsharp.org/guides/mobile-apps): Most of this centers around Xamarin; lots of the links on the F#.org site are old (2013-era).

[Enterprise](https://fsharp.org/guides/enterprise): Mostly links about why F# is good in enterprise development. A few nuggets of goodness mixed in. [Domain Modeling and DDD in F#](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/ddd/), [Domain-Driven Design (DDD) With F# and EventStore
](http://gorodinski.com/blog/2013/02/17/domain-driven-design-with-fsharp-and-eventstore/). 

[Data access](https://fsharp.org/guides/data-access/): Type providers are seriously powerful: [Accessing loosely structured data from F# and C#](http://tomasp.net/blog/goto-loosely-structured-data.aspx/index.html) [XML](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/XmlProvider.html), [JSON](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/JsonProvider.html), [SQL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh361033.aspx).

summary=A second-generation object-oriented language with functional overtones.

"Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:

* Variables are always initialized before use.
* Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.
* Integers are checked for overflow.
* Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly.
* Memory is managed automatically.
* Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.

Swift combines powerful type inference and pattern matching with a modern, lightweight syntax, allowing complex ideas to be expressed in a clear and concise manner."

- Tip: mark a workaround for a bug as deprecated in next compiler version, [@olebegemann](https://twitter.com/olebegemann/status/1294583027583123458): If you write a workaround for a bug, mark it as deprecated in the next compiler version to get a timely reminder to check if the bug has been fixed. If it has, delete the workaround. If it hasnâ€™t, update the deprecation to the next version.

- [InterposeKit](https://github.com/steipete/InterposeKit): A modern library to swizzle elegantly in Swift. [Website](https://interposekit.com/) Essentially, method interception (and rewriting/monkey-patching?) for Swift code that runs on top of the ObjC runtime. (Relies on the underlying mechanics there to do its work, it seems.) Looks pretty interesting.

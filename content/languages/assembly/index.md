## Assemblers

* [HLA (High-level assembler)](../hla)
* [FASM (flat assembler)](../fasm)
* [GNU Assembler (as)](../as)
* [Keystone assembler framework](../keystone)
* [NASM (The Netwide Assembler)](../nasm)
* [Yasm](../yasm)

## Disassemblers

* [Capstone disassembly/disassembler framework](../capstone)
* disasm: Interactive Disassembler GUI
  - Optional Intel Architecture Code Analyzer (IACA) integration
  - https://github.com/mongodb-labs/disasm
* diStorm3 binary stream disassembler library project
  - Disassembler Library For x86/AMD64: "diStorm3 is really a decomposer, which means it takes an instruction and returns a binary structure which describes it rather than static text, which is great for advanced binary code analysis."

* EmilPRO
  - EmilPRO is a graphical disassembler for a large number of instruction sets. It's a reimplementation and replacement for the Dissy disassembler.

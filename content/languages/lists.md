* [Wikipedia's List of Programming Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages).
* [List of GitHub programming languages](https://github.com/collections/programming-languages) - A list of programming languages that are actively developed on GitHub.

* [PLE](https://github.com/rtoal/ple): A collection of illustrative examples in close to 100 programming languages, including every code snippet used in the book [Programming Language Explorations](https://rtoal.github.io/ple/).
* A [Programming Language Database](https://pldb.pub/) ([Source](https://github.com/breck7/pldb)) with query capabilities (though it doesn't seem like it works at the moment?)

* [Hostiness: List of languages targeting an existing host platform](http://blog.fogus.me/2012/10/09/hostiness/)
* ['A Language a Day' Advent Calendar 2019](https://andrewshitov.com/2019/11/25/a-language-a-day-advent-calendar-2019/)

It may be fair to suggest that any language is a transformation, but there is a special meaning to the term "program transformation" -- see [here](https://www.program-transformation.org/) for more details. [Spoofax](../tools/spoofax.md) is one of these.

### Specific Languages Lists

* [Awesome Basic](https://github.com/JohnBlood/awesome-basic) - A curated list of awesome BASIC dialects, IDEs, and tutorials.
* [Awesome Lisp languages](https://github.com/dundalek/awesome-lisp-languages) - A list of Lisp-flavored programming languages.
* [Lua languages](https://github.com/hengestone/lua-languages) - Languages that compile to Lua.
* [Awesome Scheme](https://github.com/schemedoc/awesome-scheme) - A curated list of awesome Scheme libraries and resources.
* [Awesome low level programming languages](https://github.com/robertmuth/awesome-low-level-programming-languages)
* [List of languages that compile to JS](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS) - List of languages that compile to JavaScript and many other transpilers.
* [Lox implementations](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/wiki/Lox-implementations) - Lots implementations of Lox language written in many programming languages.
* [Langs written in Rust](https://github.com/alilleybrinker/langs-in-rust) - A list of programming languages implemented in Rust, for inspiration. This is a (probably incomplete) list of languages implemented in Rust. It is intended as a source of inspiration and comparison, and as a directory of potentially interesting projects in this vein.

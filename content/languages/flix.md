summary=Next-generation reliable, safe, concise, and functional-first programming language. Flix is a principled functional, imperative, and logic programming language developed at Aarhus University, at the University of Waterloo, and by a community of open source contributors. Flix is inspired by OCaml and Haskell with ideas from Rust and Scala. Flix looks like Scala, but its type system is based on Hindley-Milner. Two unique features of Flix are its polymorphic effect system and its support for first-class Datalog constraints. Flix compiles JVM bytecode, runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and supports full tail call elimination. A VSCode plugin for Flix is available.

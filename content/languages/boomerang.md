summary=Language for writing lenses (bidirectional transformations) that operate on ad-hoc, textual data formats.
~~~~~~

Every lens program, when read from left to right, describes a function that maps an input to an output; when read from right to left, the very same program describes a “backwards” function that maps a modified output, together with the original input, back to a modified input.

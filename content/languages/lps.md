title=LPS (Logic Production Systems)
tags=language, logic
summary=Aims to close the gap between logical and imperative computer languages, by performing actions to generate models to make goals of the logical form if antecedent then consequent true. Model generation serves as a global imperative, which generates commands to make consequents true whenever antecedents become true.

Implementations:

* JS: [lps.js](https://lps.js.org/) ([Source](https://github.com/mauris/lps.js)): a logic-based production system language implemented in JS that unifies both forward and backward inference methods into a single framework, embedding an agent's goals as reactive rules and its beliefs as logic programs.

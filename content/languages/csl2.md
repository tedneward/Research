summary=The C Scripting Language (CSL) is a programming language available for Windows, OS/2 and UNIX systems. CSL follows the C syntax very closely. It is used like an interpreter: a program written with an editor can be run directly like any shell script. The CSL scripting engine can be integrated into own applications as a macro language. CSL offers two programming interfaces: A "C" API for 32-bit C compilers, and C++ class interface for selected compilers.

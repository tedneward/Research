summary=XIDEK provides technical guidance and source code so that you can readily design and implement an interpreter according to your own requirements. You may need, for example, to create a special interpreter for a domain specific language, script language, or other "little language". XIDEK can save you weeks or months of work. It gives you parsers, support modules, explanations, examples, organization and a framework upon which you can build.

title=B-Juliet
tags=language
summary=β-Juliet is a fairly minimal event-oriented language. In β-Juliet, the world is modelled as a set of events which have no inherent organization or order. Each event can be denoted with a symbol, such as DominoFalls, CatMeows, or SunSets, or (in version 2.0) a string of symbols, such as Address Line Six Goes High or Greengrocer Falls Asleep on Subway. Each event can cause other events to occur — these are termed consequences of the event. In addition, this causation may be conditional, but the only condition that is possible to check is: given two events, which one happened more recently?

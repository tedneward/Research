title=V1
tags=language
summary=V1 is a simple functional interpreter language with syntax from C, PHP and JavaScript. It was developed from the scratch. The focus is on administrative and experimental programming, but it has enhanced benefits like Multithreading, CGI, Web functions and native function calling. The most buildin functions are compatible with PHP, for example fopen().

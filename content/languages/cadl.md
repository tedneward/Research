Cadl provides highly extensible core language primitives that can describe API shapes common among REST, OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC, and other protocols. Using Cadl, you can create reusable patterns for all aspects of an API, along with the ability to check for and flag known anti-patterns. These patterns establish "guardrails" for API designers and make it easier to follow best practices than deviate from them. Cadl promotes highly regular API designs that adhere to best practices by construction.

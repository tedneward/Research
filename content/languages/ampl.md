AMPL connects to most commercial and open-source solvers and allows you to switch easily between them.

AMPL has been developed for the real-world modeler who needs to manage all phases of the optimization development cycle without sacrificing computational performance. AMPLs straightforward language lets you formulate optimization models the way you think about them, and makes model logic accessible to your team members.

Using modern scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques and equation-based digital twin modeling and simulation, Dyad (formerly JuliaSim) accelerates simulation times, significantly reducing workflow runtime from months to hours. Dyad encompasses block diagrams, acausal modeling, state transition diagram and a differentiable programming language all within a single environment.

It has a 1-1 relationship between code and graphical representations, which means the same model can be inspected and interacted with in both GUI (coming soon) and code. For the coding interface, JuliaHub has released the Dyad Studio extensions for VS Code, which offers easy interactions with the compiler, static analysis to ensure correctness of physical models, and ease of authentication into the JuliaHub registries for models and launching large-scale jobs on clusters. That last part is essential for some of our big differentiators, as you can build a big model on your computer but, with a click of a button, launch of a big multi-GPU job on the cloud to train a surrogate of your model for quicker inspection!

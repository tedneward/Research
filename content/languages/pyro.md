It was designed with these key principles:

* Universal: Pyro can represent any computable probability distribution.
* Scalable: Pyro scales to large data sets with little overhead.
* Minimal: Pyro is implemented with a small core of powerful, composable abstractions.
* Flexible: Pyro aims for automation when you want it, control when you need it.

First install PyTorch. Then install Pyro via pip: `pip3 install pyro-ppl`

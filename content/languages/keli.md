title=Keli
tags=language, functional
summary=A general purpose programming language where its semantics are mostly based on the pure functional programming model (as of Haskell's) which includes user-defined algebraic datatypes, case matching and higher-order functions, while its syntactic structure is strongly influenced by Smalltalk's message sending syntax, such as the unary, binary and keywords messages; moreover, it is almost homoiconic, in the sense that all non-literal expression are functions invocation, including object definition, control structures, type annotation etc.

summary=The Glee Programming Language is a new vector oriented interpretive computer programming tool. It is inspired by array oriented languages like APL, J, and K. It attempts to deliver many of the useful and powerful features of those languages for manipulating numeric data. Further, it strives to provide new functionality for consistent and powerful manipulation of character data. It is targeted at applications where languages like PERL, Python, and Java have found secure homes. These are all scalar languages so Glee has something new to bring to the party ... vector processing.

"Learn Au" Course Outline

* Intro: What is a console app? Why use a Web API? Why use a database?
* Week 1: Console app; variables/scope; data types (`string`, `integer`, `float`, `double`, `bool`, `date`); `list`; `collection`
* Week 2: Expressions (math); operator precedence; math functions; flow control (`if`, `elseif`, `else`, `end`), operators (math relational ops); complex conditions (`true`, `false`, `and`, `or`, `not`)
* Week 3: `while`; `iterate`, `list`, `collection`; `function`
* Week 4: `userinterface`, `view`, `section`; `label`, `button`, `textbox`, `password`, `radiobutton`, `checkbox`, `datepicker`, `dropdown`; `appearance` (CSS-ish); `order`; `@` (something to do with headers and footers)
* Week 5: `entity`, member variables, member functions; `instance` (singletons); function overloading; `mixin` (mixin is a set of reusable member variables and member functions that can be used to extend an existing entity); object orientation (`entity`, `mixin`, `function`, `internal`, `protected`)
* Week 6: Documentation; code organization (`reference`, `entity`, `continuation`); default values for parameters and entities; members and parameter guards; recovery from errors (`recovery`, `raise`)
* Week 7: APIs over the Web (`external`, `webfunction`); use a code library (`external`); import a Web API and call a function from that Web API; create a code library (`external`, `library`); external support
* Week 8: Webfunction ("choose a protocol for its use"? supports maybe more than just HTTP?); documenting APIs; returning complex data (collections, lists, MIME types, files)
* Week 9: Widgets (`widget`), defining your own and nesting widgets within widgets; display a map; play video; widget containers; grid (sounds like composite-widgets-as-layout containers)
* Week 10: Data entity (`datasource`, `dataentity`, `datafunction`, `mapping`); simple data modeling (`one`, `many`, `zany`, `mapping`); retrieve data (`one`, `all`, `mapping`); save data (`add`); iterate over data (`iterate`, `next`, `dataentity`, `collection`)
* Week 11: Define two entities that have a 1:1 relationship; define two entities that have 1:n relationship; define two entities that have a 0:n ("zany") relationship; "define a prime instance and how it is different from a singleton"; modeling complex relationships in data
* Week 12: Parallel blocks; function prototypes; external inline code; inline Autron ("Automatic Transformation"); code templates

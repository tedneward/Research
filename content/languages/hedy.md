Hedy is a gradual programming language aimed at teaching programming and teaching Python. It teaches using different levels. The first level just offers printing text and asking for input. This level is meant to introduce learners to the idea of a programming language, and the environment. From there, Hedy builds up to include more complex syntax and additional concepts.

Hedy is a gradual programming language to teach children programming. Gradual languages use different language levels, where each level adds new concepts and syntactic complexity. At the end of the Hedy level sequence, kids master a subset of syntactically valid Python. [children]

title=Bosque2

summary=Bosque is an open-source project focused on developing a new Programming Language and Development Tooling Stack. The foundation of this project is the view that mechanization and automated reasoning, along with human and AI agents that leverage them, are the ideas that will define the next era of software development. The foundation of the Bosque language and stack is a carefully constructed core calculus and computation model that are uniquely amenable to automated reasoning. Building on top of this core calculus the Bosque language, as seen by a developer, is a hybrid of functional programming design, ergonomic block & assignment-based syntax, and a number of new features designed to simplify and support writing high reliability code.

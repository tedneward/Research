summary=PureBasic is a modern BASIC programming language. The key features of PureBasic are portability (Windows, Linux, OS X and Raspberry supported with the same source code), the production of very fast and optimized native 32-bit or 64-bit executables and, of course, the very simple BASIC language syntax. PureBasic has been created for the beginner and expert alike. We have put a lot of effort into its conception to produce a fast, reliable system and friendly BASIC compiler.

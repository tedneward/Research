Atto is an insanely simple functional programming language.

It features a syntax driven entirely by polish notation and no delimiters to speak of (it ignores all non-separating whitespace). What do you get for this simplicity? Well... an insanely simple language with a ~200 line self-hosted interpreter.

Despite these design limitations, it's actually possible to write quite pleasing code in Atto. That, combined with the extraordinarily extendable syntax (you can define your own operators, or overload those defined in the core library) make it ideal for solving a whole class of programming problems that are normally awkward to solve in more imperative languages.

summary=A procedural language intended first as a replacement for assembly, later taking on a life of its own as a systems-level language.

[C Specification](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf) (6 May 2005 Draft) | [C17 Standard Draft](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2310.pdf)

Frequently conjoined with [C++](/languages/cplusplus).

Numerous languages seek to supplant or replace C as the ubiquitous system language. None so far have been successful.

### Implementations:

[Cosmopolitan](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan) Libc: "makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, like Java, except it doesn't need an interpreter or virtual machine. Instead, it reconfigures stock GCC and Clang to output a POSIX-approved polyglot format that runs natively on Linux + Mac + Windows + FreeBSD + OpenBSD + NetBSD + BIOS with the best possible performance and the tiniest footprint imaginable."

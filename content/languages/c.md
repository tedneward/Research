[C Specification](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf) (6 May 2005 Draft) | 

Frequently conjoined with [C++](/languages/cplusplus).

Numerous languages seek to supplant or replace C as the ubiquitous system language. None so far have been successful.

### Implementations:

* [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html)
* [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html) from [LLVM](/platforms/llvm.html)
* Emscripten
* [TinyC](https://bellard.org/tcc/): [Website](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/tinycc) and [Git repo](https://repo.or.cz/w/tinycc.git)
* [OpenWatcom](http://www.openwatcom.org/)
* [Cheerp](https://leaningtech.com/pages/cheerp.html): C to WASM bytecode
* [PicoC](https://github.com/zsaleeba/picoc): Statically typed. Interprets a subset of C.

[Cosmopolitan](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan) Libc: "makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, like Java, except it doesn't need an interpreter or virtual machine. Instead, it reconfigures stock GCC and Clang to output a POSIX-approved polyglot format that runs natively on Linux + Mac + Windows + FreeBSD + OpenBSD + NetBSD + BIOS with the best possible performance and the tiniest footprint imaginable."

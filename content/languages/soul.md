Soul is an esoteric concatenative one-stack language, a small explorative language with an interpreter written in a day. Most concatenative languages work on a state, often that's another stack. For example, Forth has a data and return stack and Postscript has an extra stack outputting to a page. Soul is a minimalist language that provides one thing, and one thing only, the one sole stack.

The SOUL language is a small, carefully crafted DSL for writing real-time DSP code. Its design goals are to be fast, secure, safe, and simple for even beginners to learn. The SOUL runtime is a collection of tools and technologies for running SOUL code with very high efficiency, on heterogeneous CPUs and DSPs, both locally and remotely.

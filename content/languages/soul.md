The SOUL language is a small, carefully crafted DSL for writing real-time DSP code. Its design goals are to be fast, secure, safe, and simple for even beginners to learn. The SOUL runtime is a collection of tools and technologies for running SOUL code with very high efficiency, on heterogeneous CPUs and DSPs, both locally and remotely.

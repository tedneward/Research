* [Squeak by Example](https://github.com/hpi-swa-lab/SqueakByExample-english)
* [SqueakJS](https://squeak.js.org/): SqueakJS executes Squeak in a web page. It is a fully capable virtual machine implemented in pure JavaScript running unmodified Smalltalk images. Squeak is a modern implementation of Smalltalk, the original dynamic object-oriented programming environment. It runs on virtually any platform, and now in the web browser, too. SqueakJS aims to be able to run any Squeak, from the oldest 1996 version to modern ones, as well as other Squeak-derived Smalltalks like Pharo or Cuis.

summary=A language in the tradition of Self and Smalltalk, dynamic and reflective, but designed to support modularity and security.

> "Newspeak is an object-capability programming platform that lets you develop code in your web browser. The entire Newspeak IDE runs locally in the browser. It will run on desktop, tablet or phone. ... Like [Self](../../self), Newspeak is message-based; all names are dynamically bound. However, like Smalltalk, Newspeak uses classes rather than prototypes. As in Beta, classes may nest. Because class names are late bound, all classes are virtual, every class can act as a mixin, and class hierarchy inheritance falls out automatically. Top level classes are essentially self contained parametric namespaces, and serve to define component style modules, which naturally define sandboxes in an object-capability style. Newspeak was deliberately designed as a principled dynamically typed language. We plan to evolve the language to support [pluggable types](http://bracha.org/pluggableTypesPosition.pdf)."

Current [prototype](https://newspeaklanguage.org/downloads.html) is based on [Squeak](squeak.html). Update: seems to be moving to support JS-based environments (a la an Electron app).

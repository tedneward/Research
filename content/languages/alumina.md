title=Alumina
tags=language
summary=Alumina is an imperative, general-purpose, statically typed, compiled system programming language. Alumina is heavily inspired by Rust, especially in terms of syntax and standard library API. Unlike Rust, however, Alumina is not memory-safe and it requires manual memory management.

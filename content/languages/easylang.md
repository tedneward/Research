Easylang is a rather minimalistic simple programming language. Because of the clear syntax and semantics it is well suited as a teaching and learning language. Functions for graphic output and mouse input are built into the language. The language is written in C and is open source. Main target platform is the web browser using WASM. However, it also runs natively in Windows and Linux. The one-pass parser and compiler is quite fast. In the Web IDE, each time the Enter key is pressed, the program is parsed and formatted up to the current line.

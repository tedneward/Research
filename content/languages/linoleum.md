It is oriented to the developement of general-purpose applications, especially when 100% portability, execution speed and module compactness is requested. This language has an almost 1:1 source-to-CPU instruction ratio, allows direct access to five general-purpose registers (performing basic operations from a theoretical 2 up to a pratical of even 10 times faster than memory-held variables), and if used well, is averagely twice as fast as C in pure computational power.

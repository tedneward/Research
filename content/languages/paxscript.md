All pax-languages support such concepts of the modern programming as namespaces, nested classes, inheritance, static(shared) members, indexed properties, default parameters, overloaded routines, operator overloading, delegates, exception handling, regular expressions, conditional compilation. If you know VB.NET, C# or Object Pascal, you are already familiar with paxScript. 

Cross-language integration. For example, you can use modules written in paxBasic and paxC in your paxPascal scripts and vice versa. Separate compilation of the modules. Direct calling dll-defined routines. All calling conventions register, pascal, cdecl, stdcall, safecall are supported. (See demo.) Embedding scripts into html pages.

title=FixScript
tags=language
summary=FixScript is an extensible scripting language designed for simple implementation and strong support for both backward and forward compatibility. You can use FixScript both as a standalone and embedded programming language. You can build standalone native executables for any supported platform from every platform. The best results are obtained when combined with the C language to get a very powerful tool. This way you can use the best of the two worlds, using the language for the high-level stuff and C doing the interoperability and fast stuff while having a good integration between both languages.

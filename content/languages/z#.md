summary=A custom programming language I made because I don't like c++ very much (Z-Sharp's interpreter is written in c++ though).

Z-Sharp scripts have the file extension .ZS. The base syntax and formatting I would say is quite similar to C# or Python, but differs as task complexity increases. It also has support for graphics using SDL2.

summary=One of the original extension-languages to Java.
~~~~~~

The Pizza language is an extension to (then-)Java with three new features:

* Generics (aka Parametric polymorphism)
* Function pointers (aka First-class functions)
* Class cases and pattern matching (aka Algebraic types)

Furthermore you can use the Pizza compiler embedded into other applications.

Pizza was one of the forerunners of the modern collection of languages on the JVM, and as such was the source ground for many of the features now present. There's some interesting bits in here for historical perspective, and the idea that Pizza could be hosted inside of your JVM-based application was itself a fascinating tidbit at the time (such as hosting it inside of a ClassLoader to thus be able to execute Pizza source directly).

And, of course, the fact that they thought "Pizza and coffee" was the more intuitive pairing, when everybody knows it's pizza and beer.

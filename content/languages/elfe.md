summary=ELFE (Extensible Language for Everyday (and the Internet of Things)) is a very simple and small programming language specifcally designed for everyday programming, notably for the Internet of Things. While ELFE is a general-purpose programming language, it is designed to facilitate the configuration and control of swarms of small devices such as sensors or actuators. It can also be used as a powerful, remotely-accessible extension language for larger applications.

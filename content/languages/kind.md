It is a complete rewrite of [Kind1](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Kind-Legacy), based on [HVM](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM), a lazy, non-garbage-collected and massively parallel virtual machine. In our benchmarks, its type-checker outperforms every alternative proof assistant by a far margin, and its programs can offer exponential speedups over Haskell's GHC. Kind2 unleashes the inherent parallelism of the Lambda Calculus to become the ultimate programming language of the next century.

Install requires Rust: `cargo +nightly install kind2`

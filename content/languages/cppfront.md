title=Cppfront
tags=language
summary=Cppfront is an experimental compiler from a potential C++ 'syntax 2' (Cpp2) to today's 'syntax 1' (Cpp1), to learn some things, prove out some concepts, and share some ideas. This compiler is a work in progress and currently hilariously incomplete... basic functions work, classes will be next, then metaclasses and lightweight exceptions.

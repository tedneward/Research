title=OverScript
tags=language
summary=OverScript is a simple and powerful C-like statically-typed language written in C# and is great for both embedding in .NET programs and building standalone applications. The project was developed from scratch without looking back at traditional approaches to creating languages. The unique approach allows the language to go beyond the standard features and have great potential for improvement.

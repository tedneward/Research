tags=language, array
summary=A language which generalizes the array and functional capabilities of the array-programming language J to deal with a much broader variety of data structures.

Some features and design goals of I include:

* Automatic mapping. Like J's array operations, I will map over lists, sets, associated arrays, and functions.
* Soft typing built into the core of the language.
* Automatic optimization when types are known, using JIT compilation.
* Functional programming. Everything in I is a function.
* Near-nonexistent syntax. Everything is function application.
* Whitespace defines the order of precedence in a visually intuitive way.

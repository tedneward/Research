title=Frege
tags=language
summary=Frege is a Haskell for the JVM. It brings purely functional programing to the Java platform. Like any Haskell, it is purely functional, enjoys a strong static type system with global type inference and non-strict - also known as lazy - evaluation. Frege compiles to Java, runs on the JVM, and uses any Java library you want. It can be used inside any Java project.

### Implementations:

* C: [Jim Tcl](http://jim.tcl-lang.org/): Largely compatible with Tcl 8.5 with its own additions.
* JVM: [JTcl](https://github.com/jtcl-project/jtcl): Tcl 8.4 with some 8.5 features for the JVM.

### Inspired by Tcl: 

* [LIL](http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/): A Tcl-like language incompatible with mainline Tcl.

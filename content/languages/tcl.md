### Implementations:

* C: [Jim Tcl](http://jim.tcl-lang.org/): Largely compatible with Tcl 8.5 with its own additions.
* C: [Picol](https://chiselapp.com/user/dbohdan/repository/picol/): A header-only library interpreter for a limited dialect of Tcl.
* JVM: [JTcl](https://github.com/jtcl-project/jtcl): Tcl 8.4 with some 8.5 features for the JVM.
* Rust: [Molt](https://github.com/wduquette/molt): A minimal Tcl implementation for Rust applications and libraries.

### Inspired by Tcl: 

* [LIL](http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/): A Tcl-like language incompatible with mainline Tcl.

### Extensions to Tcl:

* [Poet](http://poet.sourceforge.net/): Poet extends the Tcl language with objects featuring dynamic, prototype-based inheritance, persistence, and one-way constraints. Poet includes wrappers around the Tk, Ttk, and BWidget widgets and object and code editors.

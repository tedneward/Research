summary=Designed for engineering, STEM education, and data science.
~~~~~~

A static typed language. The simplest engineering language that can be mastered by children (script-like style). Performance: as fast as Go (Go+'s main backend compiles to human-readable Go). Fully compatible with Go and can mix Go/Go+ code in the same package (see Go/Go+ hybrid programming). No DSL (Domain Specific Language) support, but it's Specific Domain Friendly (see DSL vs. SDF). Support Go code generation (main backend) and bytecode backend (REPL: see iGo+). Simplest way to interaction with C (cgo is supported but not recommended). Powerful built-in data processing capabilities.

title=Objective-J
tags=language
summary=Objective-J is a new programming language based on Objective-C. It is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid Objective-J code. Anyone familiar with JavaScript and object-oriented programming concepts, classical inheritance in particular, should have no difficulty learning Objective-J. Familiarity with Objective-C will be helpful, but it is not required.

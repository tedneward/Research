Simple summary:

* Statically typed.
* Really almost just Java on the inside.
* No checked exceptions.
* Simplified generics.
* Closures.
* Compiles to Java classes.
* Null and non-null handling.
* Simplified handling of autoboxing and primitives as objects.
* Hopefully possible to compile Java and June in one pass, allowing you to convert one file at a time.
* Uses '#' for comments to ease Unix-like scripting expectations.

title=Koka
tags=language, research
summary=A function-oriented programming language that seperates pure values from side-effecting computations, where the effect of every function is automatically inferred; Koka has many features that help programmers to easily change their data types and code organization correctly, while having a small language core with a familiar JavaScript like syntax.
~~~~~~

"The Koka project tries to see if effect inference can be used on larger scale programming. The language is strict (as in ML), but seperates pure values from side effecting computations (as in Haskell). Through the effect types, there is also a strong connection to its denotational semantics, where the effect type of each function has a direct translation to the type signature of the denotational function.
Recently, Koka fully supports user-defined effects through algebraic effect handlers."

Key features include: Expressive, mostly implicit static types and kinds. Language-incorporated unit and property tests + runners. Algebraic effects via scoped effect handlers. Algebraic data types and pattern matching on constructors. Compile-time resolved function overloading. Structurally typed tuples, records and variants. Byte-code VM-in-Go backend with straight-forward first-order FFI access. Familiar looping, branching, and variable definition syntax constructs

summary=A simple, extendable and embeddable scripting language.

The language itself has only few rules and most common language features are implemented as commands rather than part of the language itself.

### Language Goals
Duckscript scripting language goals are:

* Simple - This is probably the simplest language you will ever see.
* Extendable - Instead of having common features such as functions and conditional blocks be a part of the language, they are actually part of the API. So they can easily be replaced/modified or you can add more ‘feature’ like commands on your own.
* Embeddable - One of the main purposes of this language is to allow other libraries/executables/apps have scripting capability by embedding duckscript. Embedding is easy (for rust) and requires only few lines of code.

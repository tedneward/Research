"Squirrel is a high level imperative, object-oriented programming language, designed to be a light-weight scripting language that fits in the size, memory bandwidth, and real-time requirements of applications like video games. Although Squirrel offers a wide range of features like:

* dynamic typing
* delegation
* classes & inheritance
* higher order functions
* lexical scoping
* generators
* cooperative threads(coroutines) 
* tail recursion
* exception handling
* automatic memory management (CPU bursts free; mixed approach ref counting/GC)
* both compiler and virtual machine fit together in about 7k lines of C++ code and add only around 100kb-150kb the executable size.
* optional 16bits characters strings
* powerful embedding api
    - eg. function/classes can be defined by scripts or in C
    - eg. objects can fully exist in the VM or be bound to native code
    - eg. classes created in C can be extended by scripts or vice-versa
    - and more

"Squirrel is inspired by languages like Python,Javascript and especially Lua. (The API is very similar and the table code is based on the Lua one)"

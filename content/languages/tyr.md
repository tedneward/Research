It's meant to be both a programming language and a conlang. Programmers should think of it as a speakable programming language. Conlangers should see it as a logical conlang, which can also be used for programming. To achieve this, this language has clear and simple nesting rules based on the words, but no syntax for nesting. You can write sentences without the need of indentation. Any kind of indent is not even allowed. It's still in an early stage and only supports a few math primitives. Many things will probably be changed. I'll only document the current state here.

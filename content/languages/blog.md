Bayesian Logic (BLOG) is a probabilistic modeling language. It is designed for representing relations and uncertainties among real world objects. For instance, tracking multiple targets in a video. BLOG makes it easy and concise to represet - uncertainty about the existence (and the number) of underlying objects - uncertain relations among objects - dependencies among relations and functions - observed evidence

BLOG also provides a query language to ask questions about what the world could possibly be after making observations.

BLOG also refers to the default inference system for models specified in BLOG language.

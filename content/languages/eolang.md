EO (stands for Elegant Objects or ISO 639-1 code of Esperanto) is an object-oriented programming language based on ùúë-calculus. We're aware of popular semi-OOP languages and we don't think they are good enough, including Java, Ruby, C++, Smalltalk, Python, PHP, C#: all of them have something we don't tolerate. EO is not planning to become a mainstream language-this is not what we want. Our main goal is to prove to ourselves that true object-oriented programming is practically possible. Not just in books and abstract examples, but in real code that works. That's why EO is being created-to put all that "crazy" pure object-oriented ideas into practice and see whether they can work.

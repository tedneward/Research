title=PILL
tags=language
summary=PILL is a scripting language for applications. The syntax (based on functional languages) might look weird but it have some advantages. It contains only a minimal set of functions, applications will have to register new ones via the interpreter's API in order to make it to replay the scripts as wanted. This abstraction offers a flexible way to expand scripts abilities to virtually any domain and to allow various applications to share/re-use foreign scripts.

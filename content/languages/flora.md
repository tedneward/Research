Flora-2 (now ErgoAI) is an advanced object-oriented knowledge representation and reasoning system. It is a dialect of F-logic with numerous extensions, including meta-programming in the style of HiLog, logical updates in the style of Transaction Logic, and defeasible reasoning. Applications include intelligent agents, Semantic Web, knowledge-based networking, ontology management, integration of information, security policy analysis, and more.

Merged with ErgoAI: "April 28, 2023:  Flora-2 and ErgoAI have united! Coherent Knowledge has released ErgoAI under the open-source Apache 2.0 license and moved the development to Github. As a result, further development of Flora-2 will stop and the users are invited to switch to the ErgoAI platform. The new platform is backward compatible with the old unless one relies on low-level undocumented features or the file structure of the Flora-2 source code."

title=Lobster
tags=language, native
summary=A statically typed programming language with a Python-esque syntax that combines the advantages of an expressive type system and compile-time memory management with a very lightweight, friendly and terse syntax, by doing most of the heavy lifting for you. While it is a general purpose language, its current implementation is biased towards games and other graphical things, with plenty of “batteries included” functionality.

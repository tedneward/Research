title=Thyrd
tags=language, presentation, native
summary=An experimental, reflective, visual programming language and environment. In Thyrd, both data and code are stored in cells situated in nested two-dimensional grids. The user interface animates the transition from a cell to its subordinate or superordinate grid to help keep the user oriented in the hierarchical grid structure. All operations the user can perform to edit the structure are implemented as operators in the Thyrd language, thus a Thyrd program can inspect and modify itself or other programs in the same space.

NScript automatically compiles the code into an assembly in memory and executes the assembly. The NScript setup application associates NScript with ".ncs" (for C# scripts), ".nvb" (for VB.NET scripts) and ".njs" (for JScript .NET scripts) file extensions. This enables any code written in these files to be executed directly by double clicking on these files in windows explorer.

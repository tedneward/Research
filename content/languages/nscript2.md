summary=NScript is a tool similar to WScript except that it allows scripts to be written in .NET languages such as C#, VB.NET and JScript.NET. NScript automatically compiles the code into an assembly in memory and executes the assembly. The NScript setup application associates NScript with ".ncs" (for C# scripts), ".nvb" (for VB.NET scripts) and ".njs" (for JScript .NET scripts) file extensions. This enables any code written in these files to be executed directly by double clicking on these files in windows explorer. I wrote this tool when I needed to write a script for automating builds. A simple batch file was not sufficient for the task and I preferred to write code in C# as opposed to VBScript or JScript. This tool came in handy as I could modify the scripts easily and execute them by double clicking on the files in windows explorer.

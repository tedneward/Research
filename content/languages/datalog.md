From Wikipedia:
> Datalog is a declarative logic programming language that syntactically is a subset of Prolog. It is often used as a query language for deductive databases. In recent years, Datalog has found new application in data integration, information extraction, networking, program analysis, security, and cloud computing. Its origins date back to the beginning of logic programming, but it became prominent as a separate area around 1977 when Herv√© Gallaire and Jack Minker organized a workshop on logic and databases.

Implementations:

* [Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/datalog/index.html)
* [JVM: AbcDatalog](http://abcdatalog.seas.harvard.edu/)
* [Clojure: Cascalog](https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog)
* [OCaml](https://github.com/c-cube/datalog)
* [Erlang](https://github.com/fogfish/datalog)
* [Lua](http://datalog.sourceforge.net/): Implemented on top of Lua 5.3 and can be extended with Lua functions.

title=Halide
tags=language
summary=Halide is a language for fast, portable data-parallel computation. Also Halide designed to make it easier to write high-performance image and array processing code on modern machines. Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in C++. This means you write C++ code that builds an in-memory representation of a Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this representation to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process. Halide also provides a Python binding that provides full support for writing Halide embedded in Python without C++.

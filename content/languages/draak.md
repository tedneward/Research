What does that mean? Draak is a compiler that has the ablity to compile any language for any platform by being a generic compiler. It reads in a language description file and uses it to compile a program. It has two parts: parser and macros. The parser replaces Yacc and Lex, and the macros replaces the code generation for traditional compilers.

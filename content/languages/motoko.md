Internet Computer appears to be a blockchain-related thing: "Step into the era of blockchain as a limitless smart contract cloud that hosts everything on-chain: data, content, computations, and user experiences. Forget legacy IT and build tamperproof and unstoppable Web3 social media, gaming, virtual reality, decentralized finance, and enterprise infrastructure. Join the movement and realize the game-changing Internet Computer paradigm of full stack decentralization and seamless multi-chain today." (from [the website](https://internetcomputer.org/))

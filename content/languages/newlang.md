title=NewLang
tags=language
summary=NewLang is a high-level programming language that combines standard algorithmic constructs with declarative programming and tensor computing for machine learning problems. The main feature of the language is an easy, logical and non-contradictory syntax, which is not based on the use of reserved keywords, but on a strict system of grammatical rules using punctuation marks (which also includes language operators).

~~~~~~

"IVy is a language and a tool for specifying, modeling, implementing and verifying protcols. IVy is intended to allow interactive development of protocols and their proofs of correctness and to provide a platform for developing and experimenting with automated proof techniques. A particular focus of IVy is to provide automated proof in a way that is predictable, stable and transparent, in order to improve the overall productivity of the verification process. IVy provides interactive visualization of automated proofs, and supports a use model in which the human protocol designer and the automated tool interact to expose errors and prove correctness. The Ivy language is designed to be well suited for both abstract specification and efficient implementation."

Ivy is an interpreter for an APL-like language. It is a plaything and a work in progress.

Ivy is an extensible, dynamically typed, late binding language intended to be used as an embedded command language. It can also be used stand-alone: it can execute script files from the command line or presents a read-eval-print loop (REPL) to the user if no files are given. Ivy's extensibility is based on the fact that statements are syntactically identical to function calls. Also blocks (surrounded by braces) may be used as function arguments. Thus, new user-defined statements can be added just by defining functions. Function arguments are packaged up as thunks and may have their evaluation delayed and execution environment modified. This allows user defined functions to do many of the things that traditional language statements can do.

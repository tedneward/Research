Xtend is a statically-typed programming language which translates to comprehensible Java source code. Syntactically and semantically Xtend has its roots in the Java programming language but improves on many aspects:

* Extension methods - enhance closed types with new functionality
* Lambda Expressions - concise syntax for anonymous function literals
* ActiveAnnotations - annotation processing on steroids
* Operator overloading - make your libraries even more expressive
* Powerful switch expressions - type based switching with implicit casts
* Multiple dispatch - a.k.a. polymorphic method invocation
* Template expressions - with intelligent white space handling
* No statements - everything is an expression
* Properties - shorthands for accessing and defining getters and setter
* Type inference - you rarely need to write down type signatures anymore
* Full support for Java generics - including all conformance and conversion rules
* Translates to Java not bytecode - understand what is going on and use your code for platforms such as Android or GWT

Unlike other JVM languages Xtend has zero interoperability issues with Java: Everything you write interacts with Java exactly as expected. At the same time Xtend is much more concise, readable and expressive. Xtendâ€™s small library is just a thin layer that provides useful utilities and extensions on top of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

Of course, you can call Xtend methods from Java, too, in a completely transparent way. Furthermore, Xtend provides a modern Eclipse-based IDE closely integrated with the Eclipse Java Development Tools (JDT), including features like call-hierarchies, rename refactoring, debugging and many more.

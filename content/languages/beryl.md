title=Beryl
tags=language
summary=Beryl is a small, interpreted, embeddable scripting language with value semantics and first class functions. The main feature of Beryl is that the core interpreter can run without any dynamic memory allocation*, and it does not need to parse or compile scripts beforehand. It can also be built without any external dependencies, excluding some typedefines and constants needed from stddef.h and limits.h; however these could be provived from a custom header if needed.

title=Plato
tags=language
summary=Plato is an efficient and (hopefully!) fun programming language inspired by JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, and Haskell. Plato is designed to be easy to teach and learn while being efficient and robust enough for professional coding, particularly in the realm of 3D graphics. Plato is a statically typed functional language that looks and behaves in many ways like an object-oriented scripting language, but with a lot less complexity.

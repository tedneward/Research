summary=Rewrite is estimated to be a Turing complete, s-expression based term rewriting system. Its original intention is operating over s-expressions to expand asserted template occurrences while aiming to be intuitive enough to introduce code templating to non-technical users. To try Rewrite within browser, please refer to [Rewrite Playground](https://contrast-zone.github.io/rewrite/playground/index.html).

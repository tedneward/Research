summary=A more elegant language for a more civilized age. Juvix synthesizes a high-level frontend syntax, dependent-linearly-typed core language, whole-program optimisation system, and backend-swappable execution model into a single unified stack for writing formally verifiable, efficiently executable smart contracts which can be deployed to a variety of distributed ledgers.

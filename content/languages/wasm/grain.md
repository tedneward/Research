# The Premise
Grain is a programming language that brings wonderful features from academic and functional programming languages to the 21st century. We want these features to be accessible and easy to understand. Ideally, as you make your way through this guide, you’ll find that the language feels largely familiar and homey, with many quality-of-life improvements that you’d come to expect of any new-age language.

### The WebAssembly Bits
One of the most exciting things about Grain is that it compiles to WebAssembly. As such, Grain can run in the browser, on your computer, on a server, and potentially elsewhere. This guide will largely focus on the browser and terminal.

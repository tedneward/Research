"Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:

* Variables are always initialized before use.
* Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.
* Integers are checked for overflow.
* Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly.
* Memory is managed automatically.
* Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.

Swift combines powerful type inference and pattern matching with a modern, lightweight syntax, allowing complex ideas to be expressed in a clear and concise manner."

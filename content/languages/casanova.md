Github repo hasn't seen activity in 4 years. Looks to be two PhD theses: ["Casanova: A language for game development"](https://github.com/vs-team/casanova-mk2/blob/master/PhD%20Thesis%20Giuseppe/Print/testo.pdf) and ["PhD Thesis"](https://github.com/vs-team/casanova-mk2/blob/master/PhD%20Thesis%20Mohamed/Thesis.pdf) (which appears to be wildly unfinished).

summary=Cat9 is a user shell script for LASH - a command-line shell that discriminates against terminal emulators, written in Lua. You probably have not heard of LASH before. If you really must know, check the Backstory section below. LASH just provides some basic shared infrastructure and a recovery shell. It then runs a user provided script that actually provides most of the rules for how the command line is supposed to look and behave.

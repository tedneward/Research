[Modified version](https://github.com/atrn/ici): "This is a modified version of the ICI programming language interpreter, originally written by Tim Long and worked on by myself and others over a number of decades. ICI is a general purpose interpretive programming language that has dynamic typing and flexible data types with the flow control constructs and operators of C. It is designed for use in many environments, including embedded systems, as an adjunct to other programs, as a text-based interface to compiled libraries, and as a cross-platform scripting language with good string-handling capabilities. ICI was first made available in the early 1990s with the original implementation being in C. ICI was donated to the public domain. Given their some supericial simalarities it probably should be noted that ICI predates Javascript. At that time ICI had a number of users and formed the basis for a number of graphics oriented systems, most notably Canon's OpenPage graphics langugage. This version of ICI has been converted use C++ and modifies and extends the language in a number of ways."

title=ferite
tags=language
summary=ferite is a scripting language and engine all in one managable chunk. It is designed to be easily extended in terms of API, and to be used within other applications making them more configurable and useful to the end user. It has a syntax similiar to a number of other langauges but remains clean and it's own language. It's origins are from one of those "it seems like a good idea", the good idea was provoked by finding perl a real pain in the arse to embed (from what I gather it's easier nowadays). It started in the summer of 2000 (with various tries and fails within the pre-ceding two years). It is slowly maturing and should be fit for general consumption by the first quarter of 2003, by which point we start to add more exotic features.

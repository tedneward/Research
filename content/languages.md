Programming languages are (generally) human-friendly means of getting a computer to do something interesting on a human's behalf. Some languages may be friendlier than others; where opinions will genuinely differ as to which are friendlier, there are some that deliberately seek to be as obtuse and unreadable as possible, and those are usually called "esoteric" programming languages and fit into their own category of madness.

### General language sites/links
Some general language-wonk sorts of sites: [Lambda the Ultimate | Programming Languages Weblog](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/) | [Programming Languages Short List (PLRE.org)](http://www.plre.org/languages.html) | [Programming languages](http://microsoft.toddverbeek.com/lang.html) | [The Encyclopedia of Computer Languages](http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/) | [Programming language - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) | [Visual Programming Languages - Snapshots](http://blog.interfacevision.com/design/design-visual-progarmming-languages-snapshots/)

### Language categories

#### Assembly/Machine
Characterized by little-to-no abstraction over the target platform.

#### Procedural

#### Object-oriented

#### [Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
Functional programming brought us [monads](reading/monads.html) and all the fun that goes with that. Frequently cites/builds off of the [lambda calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).

#### [Probabalistic Programming](http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home?imm_mid=0e7ab9&cmp=em-prog-na-na-newsltr_20160910)
"Make it easier to to probabilistic inference in custom models." | [Probabalistic Models of Cognition](https://probmods.org/) | ["TOWARDS COMMON-SENSE REASONING
VIA CONDITIONAL SIMULATION: LEGACIES OF TURING IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.4799v2.pdf)

Some [slides](https://tminka.github.io/papers/mlss2009/WinnMinka-ProbabilisticProgramming-slides.pdf) on the concept; they mention a Microsoft Research language, Csoft, that does not appear in Google, and reference [InferNET](/libraries/infernet.html) as being close to what Csoft was supposed to offer.

#### Declarative

#### Static-vs-dynamic typing

#### Compiled-vs-interpreted

### Language development tools
[Pck: The Parser Construction Kit](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5163943/Pck-The-Parser-Construction-Kit): "It currently supports Yacc/Bison and Flex/lex. Support is coming for GOLD, ANTLR and possibly Coco/R. ... In addition, Pck is unique in that it exposes much of the generation process (including grammar transformation) to the console, so that you can run intermediate tools on the output before feeding into the input of the next phase of the transformation. For example, you may convert a high level representation of a grammar into the low level representation used by the engine, and then left factor it for LL(1) parsing before passing it to the generator, a bit like your compiler and linker work together."

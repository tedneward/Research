Programming languages are (generally) human-friendly means of getting a computer to do something interesting on a human's behalf. Some languages may be friendlier than others; where opinions will genuinely differ as to which are friendlier, there are some that deliberately seek to be as obtuse and unreadable as possible, and those are usually called "esoteric" programming languages and fit into their own category of madness.

### General language sites/links
Some general language-wonk sorts of sites: [Lambda the Ultimate | Programming Languages Weblog](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/) | [Programming Languages Short List (PLRE.org)](http://www.plre.org/languages.html) | [Programming languages](http://microsoft.toddverbeek.com/lang.html) | [The Encyclopedia of Computer Languages](http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/) | [Programming language - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) | [Visual Programming Languages - Snapshots](http://blog.interfacevision.com/design/design-visual-progarmming-languages-snapshots/) | [Embedded scripting languages list](https://github.com/dbohdan/embedded-scripting-languages)

### Language categories
Wikipedia defines a really large ontological breakdown of languages; I prefer a slightly smaller one.

#### Assembly/Machine
Characterized by little-to-no abstraction over the target platform.

#### Procedural

#### Object-oriented

#### [Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
Functional programming brought us [monads](reading/monads.html) and all the fun that goes with that. Frequently cites/builds off of the [lambda calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).

#### Metaprogramming (aka MetaObject Protocol)

#### Declarative

#### Static-vs-dynamic typing

#### Compiled-vs-interpreted

#### [Probabalistic Programming](http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home?imm_mid=0e7ab9&cmp=em-prog-na-na-newsltr_20160910)
"Make it easier to to probabilistic inference in custom models." | [Probabalistic Models of Cognition](https://probmods.org/) | ["TOWARDS COMMON-SENSE REASONING
VIA CONDITIONAL SIMULATION: LEGACIES OF TURING IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.4799v2.pdf)

Some [slides](https://tminka.github.io/papers/mlss2009/WinnMinka-ProbabilisticProgramming-slides.pdf) on the concept; they mention a Microsoft Research language, Csoft, that does not appear in Google, and reference [InferNET](/libraries/infernet.html) as being close to what Csoft was supposed to offer.

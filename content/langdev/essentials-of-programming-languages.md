EOPL, as it’s better known, introduces readers to the internal workings of programming languages by describing small programming languages and creating an interpreter for each one. The book is very hands-on, with lots of exercises for the reader to modify the interpreters with new features. It touches on the ideas of reasoning about languages and formal semantics, but mostly sticks to the interpreter-as-semantics approach.

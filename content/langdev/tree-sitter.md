It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

* General enough to parse any programming language
* Fast enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
* Robust enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
* Dependency-free so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C11) can be embedded in any application

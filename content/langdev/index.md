- ["A Generic Abstract Syntax Model for Embedded Languages"](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/emil-axelsson/paper.pdf): "Representing a syntax tree using a data type often involves having many similar-looking constructors. Functions operating on such types often end up having many similar-looking cases. Different languages often make use of similar-looking constructions. We propose a generic model of abstract syntax trees capable of representing a wide range of typed languages. Syntactic constructs can be composed in a modular fashion enabling reuse of abstract syntax and syntactic processing within and across languages. Building on previous methods of encoding extensible data types in Haskell, our model is a pragmatic solution to Wadler’s “expression problem". Its practicality has been confirmed by its use in the implementation of the embedded language Feldspar."

### Python

- [ast](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html): The Python official documentation of the `ast` module that ships as part of Python. "The ast module helps Python applications to process trees of the Python abstract syntax grammar. The abstract syntax itself might change with each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically what the current grammar looks like. An abstract syntax tree can be generated by passing ast.PyCF_ONLY_AST as a flag to the compile() built-in function, or using the parse() helper provided in this module. The result will be a tree of objects whose classes all inherit from ast.AST. An abstract syntax tree can be compiled into a Python code object using the built-in compile() function."

- [Code Transformer](https://github.com/danielzuegner/code-transformer): "The CodeTransformer is a Transformer based architecture that jointly learns from source code (Context) and parsed abstract syntax trees (AST; Structure). It does so by linking source code tokens to AST nodes and using pairwise distances (e.g., Shortest Paths, PPR) between the nodes to represent the AST. This combined representation is processed in the model by adding the contributions of each distance type to the raw self-attention score between two input tokens (See the paper for more details)."

A file format developed by Adobe in the 1990s to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems. Based on the [PostScript](PostScript) language, each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, including the text, fonts, vector graphics, raster images and other information needed to display it. PDF was standardized as ISO 32000 in 2008, and no longer requires any royalties for its implementation.

Extensions:
* PDF/A ([Part 1](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=38920) [Part 2](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=50655) [Part 3](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=57229)): an ISO-standardized version of the Portable Document Format (PDF) specialized for use in the archiving and long-term preservation of electronic documents. PDF/A differs from PDF by prohibiting features unsuitable for long-term archiving, such as font linking (as opposed to font embedding) and encryption.

* [PDF/E](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=42274): a format for the creation of documents used in geospatial, construction and manufacturing workflows.

* [PDF/UA](https://www.iso.org/standard/64599.html): a technical specification intended for developers implementing PDF writing and processing software, PDF/UA provides definitive terms and requirements for accessibility in PDF documents and applications.

* [PDF/VT](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=46428): an exchange format optimized for variable and transactional printing. Built on top of PDF/X-4, it is the first variable-data printing (VDP) format which ensures modern International Color Consortium-based (ICC) color management through the use of ICC Output Intents.

* [PDF/X](): a format (ISO 15930) designed to facilitate graphics exchange, and it therefore has a series of printing-related requirements which do not apply to standard PDF files. Several implementation specifications:
  * [PDF/X-1a:2003](https://www.iso.org/standard/39938.html)
  * [PDF/X-3:2003](https://www.iso.org/standard/39940.html)
  * [PDF/X-4](https://www.iso.org/standard/42876.html)
  * [PDF/X-5](https://www.iso.org/standard/42877.html)

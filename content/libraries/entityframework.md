["Using strongly-typed entity IDs to avoid primitive obsession"](https://andrewlock.net/series/using-strongly-typed-entity-ids-to-avoid-primitive-obsession/): "using strongly-typed IDs to represent different types of entity ID.

I look at how to create types to represent the IDs and how to create converters so they interoperate easily with ASP.NET Core and EF Core."

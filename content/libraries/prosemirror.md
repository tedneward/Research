Rich content editors should, ideally, produce clean, semantically meaningful documents while still being easy for users to understand. ProseMirror tries to bridge the gap between editing explicit, unambiguous content like Markdown or XML, and classical WYSIWYG editors.

It does this by implementing a WYSIWYG-style editing interface for documents more constrained and structured than plain HTML. You can customize the shape and structure of the documents your editor creates, and tailor them to your application's needs.

The stb libraries are a collection of single-file header-file libraries for C/C++ in the public domain, primarily aimed at game developers. They are designed to be easy to integrate, easy to use, and easy to release. Some libraries are bread-and-butter (image file loading), some are deeply esoteric (level generation).

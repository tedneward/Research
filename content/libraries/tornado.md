Features:

* Asynchronous and non-blocking.
* Has a built-in template engine.
* Has built-in support for secured cookies.
* Can handle thousands of simultaneous connection

Advantages:

* High performance: Tornado is designed to handle high traffic, making it a great choice for building scalable applications.
* Web framework and asynchronous networking library: Tornado provides both a web framework and an asynchronous networking library, making it easy to build both web and networking applications.
* Real-time applications: Tornado has built-in support for WebSockets, making it an excellent choice for real-time applications like chat, gaming, and data streaming.
* Built-in security features: Tornado comes with built-in security features like CSRF protection and XSS mitigation, making it a safe choice for building web applications.

Disadvantages:

* The framework is relatively low-level compared to some other options, which means that developers may need to write more code to implement certain features.
* Asynchronous programming can be difficult to learn and debug for some developers who are not familiar with it.
* Tornadoâ€™s emphasis on non-blocking I/O can lead to increased complexity in some cases, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.

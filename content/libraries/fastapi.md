Features: 

* Performance: FastAPI uses advanced features such as async/await syntax and type hints to provide high performance and scalability.
* Ease to code: FastAPI is designed to be easy to use, with a clear and concise syntax that makes it simple to define routes, parameters, and response models.
* Reduced bugs: FastAPI uses Python-type hints to define request and response data structures, which can be used to validate incoming data automatically. This makes it easy to build self-documenting APIs and reduces the likelihood of errors or bugs in your code.
* Asynchronous nature: FastAPI uses Python-type hints to define request and response data structures, which can be used to validate incoming data automatically. This makes it easy to build self-documenting APIs and reduces the likelihood of errors or bugs in your code.

Advantages:

* Easy to execute: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks. You can also use FastAPI to create APIs even with limited programming knowledge. 
* Built-in monitoring tools: FastAPI comes with inbuilt monitoring tools that can provide alerts when you reach certain thresholds. 
* Easy to adapt: FastAPI uses a toolkit-based approach, so you don’t have to create everything from scratch. You can thus use various boilerplates to create powerful APIs. 

Disadvantages:

* Small community: One of the major drawbacks of FastAPI is its small community. A small community can hinder Fast API Python development because there is less supporting documentation available freely. 
* Lacks inbuilt security system: FastAPI lacks an inbuilt security system but uses fast API.security module.

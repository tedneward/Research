> "Massive is not an object-relational mapper (ORM)! It doesn't use models, it doesn't track state, and it doesn't box you into working and thinking in terms of individual entities, barely scratching the surface of what PostgreSQL can do. Instead, Massive analyzes and builds an API for the data model expressed in your database's tables, views, and functions, simplifying routine SQL generation without hiding SQL itself so your applications can use Postgres to the fullest possible extent."

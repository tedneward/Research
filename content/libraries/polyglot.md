From the website:
> Polyglot is a highly extensible compiler front end for the Java programming language. It is implemented as a Java class framework using design patterns to promote extensibility. Using Polyglot, language extensions can be implemented without duplicating code from the framework itself. Polyglot has been used to implement domain-specific languages, to explore language design ideas, to simplify Java for pedagogical purposes, and for various code transformations such as optimization and fault injection. Polyglot has been used for both major and minor language extensions; our experience suggests that the cost of implementing an extension scales well with the degree to which it modifies Java.

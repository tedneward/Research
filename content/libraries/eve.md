Advantages:

* Easy and quick setup for creating RESTful APIs with a MongoDB backend.
* Flexible data validation and authentication mechanisms.
* Built-in support for pagination and filtering of API responses.
* Automatic generation of API documentation using Swagger UI.
* Customizable URL routing and endpoint configuration.
* Support for various response formats such as JSON, XML, and CSV.
* It has built-in caching support which makes it more efficient by reducing the load on the server side.

Disadvantages:

* Limited support for databases other than MongoDB.
* Limited options for customization and extension beyond the built-in features.
* The steep learning curve for developers who are not familiar with MongoDB or RESTful API development.
* Limited community support and resources compared to more popular frameworks such as Flask or Django.
* Lack of support for advanced features such as WebSocket connections or real-time updates.

Eve is powered by Flask and Cerberus and it offers native support for MongoDB data stores. Support for SQL, Elasticsearch and Neo4js backends is provided by community extensions.

Features:

* Asynchronous, non-blocking I/O for improved performance
* Built-in support for HTTP and web sockets
* Request routing and middleware support
* Flexible and customizable, with support for plugins and extensions
* Supports both function and class-based views
* Built-in support for Swagger API documentation

Advantages:

* Sanic is also lightweight and scalable, making it a good choice for building both small and large-scale applications.
* One of its key advantages is its use of asynchronous, non-blocking I/O, which allows for improved performance and scalability.
* With features such as request routing and middleware support, Sanic provides developers with a lot of control over their applications. Additionally, Sanic offers a number of performance optimizations, such as the ability to run multiple server processes in parallel.

Disadvantages:

* Though Sanic has a lot of flexibility and control, it requires more time and effort to configure and set up than other web frameworks.
* Since Sanic doesnâ€™t have good community support when compared with other frameworks, it might not be the preferred one.
* Sanic has an asynchronous property which makes it comparatively difficult to debug any issues.

A group of organizations are working together to define a common set of annotation types for use in JVM languages, to improve static analysis and language interoperation. Our initial focus is on nullness analysis.

This includes providing both an artifact of annotation types your code can depend on (in the org.jspecify.annotations package), and precise specifications of their semantics.

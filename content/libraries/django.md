Features:

* Web browsable APIs and has huge usability for developers
* Multiple in-built authentication policies
* Serialization which supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources
* Extensive and good documentation to refer to and learn
* A very active community support
* Trusted by organizations like Red Hat, Mozilla, Heroku
* Supports automatic URL routing to Django
* Supports testing, caching, throttling, etc.

Advantage:

* Development friendly: Django REST has pre-built tools and libraries that help developers quickly build and iterate on RESTful APIs, saving time and effort.
* Serialization: Django REST has a powerful serialization engine that makes it easy to convert complex Python objects into JSON, XML, or other content types that are commonly used by RESTful APIs.
* Authentication and Authorization: It provides built-in support for a wide range of authentication and authorization methods, including Token-based authentication, OAuth2, and JWT. This allows developers to build secure APIs with ease.
* Personalizable: It is highly customizable and allows developers to override and customize almost every aspect of the API development process, including authentication, serialization, and view behavior.
* Testing friendly: It provides a comprehensive set of tools for testing APIs, including a test client, API request factory, and test case classes. This makes it easy for developers to write and run tests for their APIs.
* Good documentation support: Django REST has extensive and well-written documentation, which makes it easy for developers to learn and use the framework. The documentation includes examples and tutorials that help developers get started quickly.
* Huge community base: Django REST has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the framework and provide support through forums, mailing lists, and other resources. This means that developers can easily find help and support when they need it.

Disadvantage:

* Difficult to get started: Django REST can have a steep learning curve for developers who are not familiar with Django. This can make it challenging to get started with the framework, customize or make modifications.
* Not fit for simple lightweight applications: It provides a lot of built-in functionality, which can make it more heavyweight than some other API frameworks. 
* Object Relational Mapper(ORM) limitations: ORM is for sending data between a database and a model in an application. Django Rest is tightly integrated with Djangoâ€™s ORM, which can be a limitation if you need to work with a different ORM or database.
* Security issues: As with any web framework, security is a concern when building APIs with Django REST. While it provides some built-in security features, developers still need to be careful to properly secure their API endpoints and user data.

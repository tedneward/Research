"Infer.NET is a framework for running Bayesian inference in graphical models. It can also be used for probabilistic programming as shown in this video. 

"You can use Infer.NET to solve many different kinds of machine learning problems, from standard problems like classification, recommendation or clustering through to customised solutions to domain-specific problems. Infer.NET has been used in a wide variety of domains including information retrieval, bioinformatics, epidemiology, vision, and many others."

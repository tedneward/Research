> In addition to 1:1 bindings, Silk.NET provides high-level abstractions over multimedia windowing and input such that one common API layer may be used to seemlessly develop for a wide range of platforms such as Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS. Silk.NET is the one library you'll need to form a solid foundation to power your .NET games, game engines, scientific visualization applications, and just about anything else that needs high-grade graphics or compute abilities!

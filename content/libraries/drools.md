Drools is a business rule management system with a forward-chaining and backward-chaining inference based rules engine, allowing fast and reliable evaluation of business rules and complex event processing. A rule engine is also a fundamental building block to create an expert system which, in artificial intelligence, is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert.

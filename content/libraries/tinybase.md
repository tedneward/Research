> Using plain old JavaScript objects to manage data gets old very quickly. It's error-prone, tricky to track changes efficiently, and easy to mistakenly incur performance costs. TinyBase is a smarter way to structure your application state: **Familiar concepts** of tables, rows, and cells, and schematization to model your data domain. **Flexibly reactive** to reconciled updates, so you only spend cycles on the data that changes. **Indexing, metrics, relationships** - and even an undo stack for your app state! - out of the box. **Easily sync** your data to local or remote storage, and use idiomatic bindings to your React UI.

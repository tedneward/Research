> Dynamic languages are widely used due to the flexibility needed in some applications or systems. Therefore, dynamic language metaprogramming features have been incorporated gradually to statically-typed languages. Our work is aimed to improve the flexibility of Java language without modifying the Java Virtual Machine. We developed a library that allows Java language to support two types of metaprogramming features: 1) structural intercession y 2) dynamic code evaluation. This was achieved using class versioning, code instrumentation and Hot-Swapping. In conclusion, the library allows programmers to use these two functionalities in new or legacy code to improve its runtime flexibility.

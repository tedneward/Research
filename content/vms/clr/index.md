summary=The execution engine and supporting structure for .NET programs.

List of CLR VM implementations:
* [CoreCLR](../coreclr), part of [.NET Core](/platforms/clr/dotnetcore)
* [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/runtime/), which was acquired by Microsoft a few years ago | [Source](https://github.com/mono/mono)

There used to be more (below), but interest appears to have waned after an early surge.

* Shared Source CLI (aka "Rotor"); [SSCLI Essentials](../sscli-essentials) is a good place to start to understand the CLR codebase ("runtime") itself.

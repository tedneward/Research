From the website:
> OMR is enterprise-class runtime technology that delivers high performance without sacrificing versatility or robustness. OMR components are built to be extensible. It is easy to get started, and then to incrementally add powerful capabilities to your runtime. OMR takes care of the core capabilities that are common to all runtimes, so that you can focus on the unique requirements of your language.

Small and easily embeddable: just a few C files, no external dependency, 210 KiB of x86 code for a simple hello world program. An online demonstration of the QuickJS engine with its mathematical extensions is available at numcalc.com. It was compiled from C to WASM/asm.js with Emscripten. *(There is something deeply satisfying about compiling a JS engine to WASM and running JS inside of JS.)*

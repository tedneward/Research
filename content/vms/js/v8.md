[V8 Dev Blog](https://v8.dev/blog):

* [Oilpan](/libraries/oilpan) is a standalone garbage collection library for C++ hosted by the V8 project.
* WebAssembly topics:
    * [Up to 4GB of memory](https://v8.dev/blog/4gb-wasm-memory): Thanks to recent work in Chrome and Emscripten, you can now use up to 4GB of memory in WebAssembly applications. That’s up from the previous limit of 2GB.
    * [Introducing `wasm-decompile`](https://v8.dev/blog/wasm-decompile): wasm-decompile produces output that tries to look like a "very average programming language" while still staying close to the Wasm it represents.
    * [Standalone WebAssembly binaries using Emscripten](https://v8.dev/blog/emscripten-standalone-wasm): Emscripten has always focused first and foremost on compiling to the Web and other JavaScript environments like Node.js. But as WebAssembly starts to be used without JavaScript, new use cases are appearing, and so we've been working on support for emitting standalone Wasm files from Emscripten, that do not depend on the Emscripten JS runtime!
    * [Emscripten and the LLVM WebAssembly backend](https://v8.dev/blog/emscripten-llvm-wasm): WebAssembly is normally compiled from a source language, which means that developers need tools to use it. Because of that, the V8 team works on relevant open-source projects like LLVM, Emscripten, Binaryen, and WABT. This post describes some of the work we’ve been doing on Emscripten and LLVM, which will soon allow Emscripten to switch to the LLVM WebAssembly backend by default — please test it and report any issues!
    * [Code caching for WebAssembly developers](https://v8.dev/blog/wasm-code-caching): There’s a saying among developers that the fastest code is code that doesn’t run. Likewise, the fastest compiling code is code that doesn’t have to be compiled. WebAssembly code caching is a new optimization in Chrome and V8 that tries to avoid code compilation by caching the native code produced by the compiler. We’ve written about how Chrome and V8 cache JavaScript code in the past, and best practices for taking advantage of this optimization. In this blog post, we describe the operation of Chrome’s WebAssembly code cache and how developers can take advantage of it to speed up loading for applications with large WebAssembly modules.
* [Sparkplug](https://v8.dev/blog/sparkplug): a non-optimizing JavaScript compiler
* [Short builtin calls](https://v8.dev/blog/short-builtin-calls): we’ve realized that function calls between embedded builtins and JIT compiled code can come at a considerable performance penalty. This cost depends on the microarchitecture of the CPU. In this post we’ll explain why this is happening, what the performance looks like, and what we’re planning to do to resolve this long-term.
* [Super fast property access](https://v8.dev/blog/fast-super): The super keyword can be used for accessing properties and functions on an object’s parent.
* [Faster JavaScript calls](https://v8.dev/blog/adaptor-frame): JavaScript allows calling a function with a different number of arguments than the expected number of parameters, i.e., one can pass fewer or more arguments than the declared formal parameters. The former case is called under-application and the latter is called over-application.
* [An additional non-backtracking RegExp engine](https://v8.dev/blog/non-backtracking-regexp): V8 ships with a new experimental non-backtracking RegExp engine (in addition to the existing Irregexp engine) which guarantees execution in linear time with respect to the size of the subject string.
* [Indicium](https://v8.dev/blog/system-analyzer): This system analyzer is a unified web interface to trace, debug and analyse patterns of how Inline Caches (ICs) and Maps are created and modified in real-world applications. V8 already has a tracing infrastructure for ICs and Maps which can process and analyse IC events using the IC Explorer and Map events using Map Processor. However, previous tools didn't allow us to analyze maps and ICs holistically and this is now possible with system analyzer.
* [Slack tracking](https://v8.dev/blog/slack-tracking): Slack tracking is a way to give new objects an initial size that is larger than what they may actually use, so they can have new properties added quickly. And then, after some period of time, to magically return that unused space to the system. Neat, huh?
* [High-performance garbage collection for C++](https://v8.dev/blog/high-performance-cpp-gc): Because the C++ object graph around the DOM is heavily tangled with Javascript objects, the Chromium team switched a couple of years ago to a garbage collector, called Oilpan, for managing this kind of memory. Oilpan is a garbage collector written in C++ for managing C++ memory that can be connected to V8 using cross-component tracing that treats the tangled C++/JavaScript object graph as one heap.
* Understanding the ECMAScript spec: [Part 1](https://v8.dev/blog/understanding-ecmascript-part-1) | [Part 2](https://v8.dev/blog/understanding-ecmascript-part-2) | [Part 3](https://v8.dev/blog/understanding-ecmascript-part-3) | [Part 4](https://v8.dev/blog/understanding-ecmascript-part-4)
* Blazingly-fast parsing: [Part 1: the scanner](https://v8.dev/blog/scanner) | [Part 2: lazy parsing](https://v8.dev/blog/preparser)
* [Pointer compression in V8](https://v8.dev/blog/pointer-compression): There is a constant battle between memory and performance. As users, we would like things to be fast as well as consume as little memory as possible. Unfortunately, usually improving performance comes at a cost of memory consumption (and vice versa).
* [Improving V8 regular expressions](https://v8.dev/blog/regexp-tier-up): In its default configuration, V8 compiles regular expressions to native code upon the first execution. As part of our work on JIT-less V8, we introduced an interpreter for regular expressions. Interpreting regular expressions has the advantage of using less memory, but it comes with a performance penalty. In this blog post we describe how we take advantage of the upsides of interpreting regular expressions while mitigating the downsides.
* [A lighter V8](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-lite): In late 2018 we started a project called V8 Lite, aimed at dramatically reducing V8’s memory usage. Initially this project was envisioned as a separate Lite mode of V8 specifically aimed at low-memory mobile devices or embedder use-cases that care more about reduced memory usage than throughput execution speed. However, in the process of this work, we realized that many of the memory optimizations we had made for this Lite mode could be brought over to regular V8 thereby benefiting all users of V8.
* [Code caching for Javascript developers](https://v8.dev/blog/code-caching-for-devs): In this blog post, we offer a few pieces of advice for JS developers who want to make the best use of code caching to improve the startup of their websites. This advice focuses on the implementation of caching in Chrome/V8, but most of it is likely transferable to other browsers’ code caching implementations too.

[Java bindings for V8](https://github.com/eclipsesource/J2V8): J2V8 is a set of Java bindings for V8. J2V8 focuses on performance and tight integration with V8. It also takes a 'primitive first' approach, meaning that if a value can be accessed as a primitive, then it should be. This forces a more static type system between the JS and Java code, but it also improves the performance since intermediate Objects are not created. We developed J2V8 as a high performance engine for our multi-platform mobile toolkit tabris.js and it is a great choice for executing JavaScript on Android devices.

Salt is a System-F variant intended as an intermediate language between higher level languages and an abstract assembly language (LLVM). Hand written code can also be used to implement runtime systems. The Disco Discus Compiler uses an earlier version of Salt (v1), and its runtime system is written in it. This current repo contains a newer version of Salt (v2) which is being split out into its own project. Salt v1 has a working LLVM backend, but the one for v2 in this repo is still a work in progress.

This project is a V2; see the Github for more notes and links to V1.

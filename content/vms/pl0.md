PL/0 is a collection of tools for learning about parsers, interpreters, compilers and virtual machines. It has been designed from the ground up to be a minimal implementation of several common interpreter and compiler functions, including the following:

* Lexical analysis and tokenisation.
* Recursive descent parsing to an abstract syntax tree.
* Direct syntax-tree interpretation.
* Static compilation to a stack based assembly language.
* Assembly from symbolic assembly language to virtual op-codes.
* Virtual machine execution using a stack-based computer.

Virtual Machines differ from platforms in that a virtual machine may form the core of a platform. Virtual machines typically provide an environment for executing code (either a bytecode set unique to the VM or, in rare cases, compiled machine code) and often provide a set of services to that executing code, such as code-loading, execution access control and security, garbage collection, metadata access, and so on.

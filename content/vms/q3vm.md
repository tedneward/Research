[GitHub](https://github.com/jnz/q3vm)

A lightweight (single file: vm.c) embeddable interpreter/Virtual Machine (VM) for compiled bytecode files (.qvm) based on good old C-language input (.c). A complete C compiler to generate .qvm files is included (LCC). The interpreter is based on the Quake III Arena virtual machine (hence the name q3vm) but the interpreter is not tied to Quake III Arena and can be used for any kind of project. For example code that needs to run in a sandbox.

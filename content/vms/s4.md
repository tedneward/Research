#### README
I think of S4 as a stack-based, RPN, Forth-like, virtual CPU/VM that can have as many registers, functions, and amount of user ram as the system supports.

A register is identified by up to 3 UPPER-case characters, so there is a maximum or (26x26x26) = 17576 registers available. I tend to think of registers as built-in variables. Reading, setting, incrementing or decrementing a register is a single operation.

A function is identified by any number of UPPER-case characters. The maximum number of functions is set in the config.h file.

The number of registers, function vectors, and user memory can be scaled as desired to fit into a system of any size. For example, on an ESP-8266 board, a typical configuration might be 576 (26*26) registers, 5000 functions, and 24K of user ram. In such a system, register names would be in the range of [aa.zz]. For a RPI Pico, I use 576 registers, 1000 functions, and 128K USER RAM. On a Arduino Leonardo, you might configure the system to have 26 registers and functions, and 1K USER. On a Windows or Linux system, I use 17576 registers (26*26*26), 5000 functions, and 1MB USER.

* Example 1: "Hello World!" - the typical "hello world" program.
* Example 2: 1sA 2sB 3sC rA rB rC ++ . - would print 6.
* Example 4: 32 126[13,10,rI#."-",] - would print the ASCII table
* Example 3: 1000sS 13xPO 1{1 13 xPWD rS xW 0 13 xPWD rS xW} - the typical Arduino "blink" program.

There were multiple reasons why to do this:

1. Many interpreted environments use tokens and a large SWITCH statement in a loop to execute the user's program. In these systems, the "machine code" (i.e. - byte-code ... the cases in the SWITCH statement) are often arbitrarily assigned and are not human-readable, so they have no meaning to the programmer when looking at the code that is actually being executed. Additionally there is a compiler and/or interpreter, often something similar to Forth, that is used to create the programs in that environment. For these enviromnents, there is a steep learning curve ... the programmer needs to learn the user environment and the hundreds or thousands of user functions in the libraries (or "words" in Forth). I wanted to avoid as much as that as possible, and have only one thing to learn: the machine code.

2. I wanted to be free of the need for a multiple gigabyte tool chain and the edit/compile/run paradigm for developing everyday programs.

3. I wanted a simple, minimal, and interactive programming environment that I could modify easily.

4. I wanted an environment that could be easily configured for and deployed to many different types of development boards via the Arduino IDE.

5. I wanted to be able to use the same environment on my personal computer as well as development boards.

6. I wanted short commands so there was not a lot of typing needed.

S4 is the result of my work towards those goals.

The implementation of S4

* The entire system is implemented in a few files. The engine is in S4.cpp.
* There are a few additional files to support optional functionality (e.g - WiFi and File access).
* The same code runs on Windows, Linux, and multiple development boards (via the Arduino IDE).
* See the file "config.h" for system configuration settings.

### REGISTERS and LOCALS
NOTES:
- Register names are 1 to 3 UPPERCASE characters: [rA..rZZZ]
- LOCALS: S4 provides 10 locals per call [r0..r9].
- The number of registers is controlled by the NUM_REGS #define in "config.h".
- Register 'rI' is the FOR Loop index **special**

### WORDS/FUNCTIONS
NOTES:
- Word/Function names are ProperCase identifiers. 
- They must begin with [A..Z], and can include lowercase characters [a..z].
- The number of words is controlled by the NUM_FUNCS #define in "config.h"
- NUM_FUNCS needs to be a power of 2.
- If a word has already been defined, S4 prints "-redef-".

# Adding new functionality to S4:

In run(start) (S4.cpp), in the "switch" statement, there are cases available for direct support of new instructions, mostly unused lowercase characters. New functionality can be put there by comandeering one of the /\* FREE \*/ cases.

S4 also has "extended" instructions. These are triggered by the 'x' case. All extended instructions begin with 'x'. For extended instructions, function doExt() is called. It behaves in a similar way to run(), by setting 'ir = \*(pc++)' and a switch statement. The "default:" case calls an external function, doCustom(ir, pc). That is where I usually put system-specific functionality; (eg - pin manipulation for Arduino Boards). Function doCustom(ir, pc) needs to return the address where pc should continue.

As an example, I will add Gamepad/Joystick simulation to S4 as extended instructions. This example uses the HID-Project from NicoHood (https://github.com/NicoHood/HID).

Import the library into Arduino using "Import Library".

In the doCustom(ir, pc) function (S4.ino), add a new case for ir. In this case, I am adding case 'G'.

```
addr doCustom(byte ir, addr pc) {
    ir = *(pc++);
    switch (ir) {
    ...
    case 'G': pc = doGamePad(ir, pc);        break;
    ...
    }
    return pc;
}
```

Then it is a simple matter of implementing doGamePad(ir, pc):

```
\#ifdef __GAMEPAD__
\#include <HID-Project.h>
\#include <HID-Settings.h>
addr doGamePad(byte ir, addr pc) {
    ir = *(pc++);
    switch (ir) {
    case 'X': Gamepad.xAxis(pop());          break;
    case 'Y': Gamepad.yAxis(pop());          break;
    case 'P': Gamepad.press(pop());          break;
    case 'R': Gamepad.release(pop());        break;
    case 'A': Gamepad.dPad1(pop());          break;
    case 'B': Gamepad.dPad2(pop());          break;
    case 'L': Gamepad.releaseAll();          break;
    case 'W': Gamepad.write();               break;
    default:
        isError = 1;
        printString("-notGamepad-");
    }
    return pc;
}
\#else
addr doGamePad(addr pc) { printString("-noGamepad-"); return pc; }
\#endif
```

The last thing to do is \#define \_\_GAMEPAD\_\_. This is best done in "config.h".

```
...
#elif __BOARD__ == XIAO
  #define __GAMEPAD__
  #define STK_SZ          8
  #define LSTACK_SZ       4
  #define USER_SZ        (22*1024)
  #define NUM_REGS       (26*26)
 ...
```


Now in S4, you can do things like: 

3 xGP xGW  0(Press button 3)
3 xGR xGW  0(Release button 3)

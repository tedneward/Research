> What’s neat is that no prior knowledge of category theory is assumed! They write for a broad audience: motivated HS students, machine learning researchers, retired programmers, pure math’ns…, & each ch. is based on real-world topics like electrical circuits and control theory. I love what they share in the Preface: “The motto at MIT is ‘mens et manus,’ Latin for ‘mind and hand.’ We believe that category theory—and pure math in general—has stayed in the realm of mind for too long; it is ripe to be brought to hand.” – [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/math3ma)

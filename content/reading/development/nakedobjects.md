[Richard Pawson's Thesis](http://isis.apache.org/versions/2.0.0-M1/guides/ugfun/resources/core-concepts/Pawson-Naked-Objects-thesis.pdf) was the backbone of this. Later, after creating the original Naked Objects framework (in Java Swing), he wrote [a book](http://www.nakedobjects.org/book/) (now unfortunately woefully out of date in terms of implmentation) on it.

See also: [Naked Objects Framework](/presentation/nakedobjects) and [Apache Isis](/presentation/isis), the two direct successors to Pawson's work for the CLR and JVM, respectively.

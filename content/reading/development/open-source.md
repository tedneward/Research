[CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/) (Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software): CHAOSS is a Linux Foundation project focused on creating metrics, metrics models, and software to better understand open source community health on a global scale. CHAOSS is an acronym for Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software. Open source software is critically important for both individuals and organizations. This importance raises questions about how we understand the health of the open-source projects we rely on. Unhealthy projects can have negative impacts on the community involved in the project as well as organizations that rely on such projects.

The principal novelty of the series is that every detail is one hundred percent formalized and machine-checked: the entire text of each volume, including the exercises, is literally a "proof script" for the Coq proof assistant.

The exposition is intended for a broad range of readers, from advanced undergraduates to PhD students and researchers. No specific background in logic or programming languages is assumed, though a degree of mathematical maturity is helpful. A one-semester course can expect to cover Logical Foundations plus most of Programming Language Foundations or Verified Functional Algorithms, or selections from both.

Six parts:

* [Logical Foundations (Vol 1)](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html) ([Download](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/lf.tgz))
* [Programming Language Foundations (Vol 2)](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html) ([Download](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/plf.tgz))
* [QuickChick: Property-Based Testing in Coq (Vol 3)](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/qc-current/index.html) ([Download](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/qc-current/qc.tgz))
* [Verifiable C (Vol 4)](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/vc-current/index.html) ([Download](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/vc-current/vc.tgz))

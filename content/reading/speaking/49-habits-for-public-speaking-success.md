* **Can we create a great talk?** Be willing to accept feedback; have a positive attitude; mental and physical preparation before the talk
* **Open with a great first line** Audience does not want to be manipulated into sharing their feelings. Don't ask, "How are we tonight?" Why would we ask a question that leads to anything other than a positive outcome? Use a guaranteed opening, like telling a story, asking a question, or doing an activity. Get the audience leaning forward with compelling statements. We want the audience focused on wanting to hear more.
* **Get your speed right** Practice speaking slowly.
* **Love the microphone** Practice holding hairbrush/shampoo bottle. Hold it close to your mouth, just a few inches away. (Rest on chin.) 
* **Manage your water intake**
* **Stay on time!**
* **Mind your gaps and pauses Ums/ahs/well/so crutch words.** 
* **You can do better than "Hello"** Plan a strong opening
* **Do not drink alcohol before or during a talk!**
* **Avoid dehydration** Particularly for hot climates/situations
* **Get the volume right**
* **Put variety into the speech** No monotones
* **Trust the technicians, but test beforehand** Prepare for the worst; what will you do when you are outside, and no slides or computers are available?
* **Dress for success**
* **Keep the food in the green room**
* **Relax and do your best** Nervous speakers think the audience wants to know they are nervous; audience is now focusing on the speaker's nerves and issues, which removes the focus from the speech. Only say what we want the audience to focus on.
* **Never apologize** Some speakers apologize because they want to downplay the audience's expectations. Do not apologize. No one wants to hear it. A confident start gives the audience permission to enjoy our talk.
* **The weather doesn't matter** Do not talk about the weather unless it is relevant to the talk.
* **Location, location, location**
* **Being funny is an art form**
* **Be well rested**
* **Control the body** Try not to be tied to a podium; if we can walk, we will not get as tired.
* **Pause. Breathe. Continue.** Best presentation has moments of silence. This is for the audience to reflect and consider what was said. If we talk too fast or do not pause, we can provide information overload, and then no one remembers anything.
* **Variety, not monotone** Monotones can be cured by increasing the volume. Watch TV news reporters and listen for the melody in their voices. Watch cartoons and listen to the changes in tone, pitch and volume of each character.
* **Don't hurry up, just wrap it up** Prepare a plan for when the talk goes off its original path. Know what can be cut from the presentation so you can finish on time.
* **Close well** Practice closing/ending. Tell the audience what you would like them to do at the end (call to action). Show them what additional resources are available.
* **Panel discussions (if you have to)** Have clear and specific topics for the panel discussion. Everyone must know the guidelines and stick to them. Have a moderator who will keep things on track. Engage the audience with questions they can respond to. Know the rules for interacting with the other panelists and respect when the other panelists are talking. Be prepared to answer questions from the audience and give concise answers. Every speaker should have equal time talking.
* **Don't let the small stuff stop you starting well** Tell a joke. Open with a story. Ask a question. Do an activity. Ask for a volunteer. Share something personal. Tell a secret. (Get the opening right.)
* **Your attitude matters** Keep it positive with all management, organizing staff, and anyone talking to the audience.
* **Use the microphone**
* **Take the feedback**
* **One introduction is enough** Getting started is better than sharing 20 years of your past experience. In a speech/TedTalk, the value you bring is your content, not your name. You are just the delivery vehicle for your message.
* **Be clear**
* **Focus on the audience** Focus on delivering good material right away. Realize when we are wasting people's time, and what is valuable. Audience wants solutions right away.
* **Spare us the name-dropping** People trust in the reality of a personal story; they do not believe us when we have to refer to other people all the time. When we have the confidence to share original material, there is a better connection.
* **Talk with the audience** Every talk needs to be made in such a way that it is a conversation. The most effective presentation is focused on the audience, and a speech that engages the audience's values and interests will be applauded.
* **Make your facts real** Never use a fact as a fact without research.
* **Speak well of others**
* **Beware your dominant thoughts** Never mention a topic you do not want to talk about, and try not to think about anything that could distract. Stay on topic.
* **Don't point**
* **Talk towards the audience** Try to always keep your back to the side or back of the room. Aim to make eye contact with someone every five to seven seconds. If you have a big screen behind you, do not look at it. Use the laptop or monitors instead.
* **They are already listening--talk already** Observe what the audience looks like in the beginning when they are all paying attention. If the body language and facial expressions stay the same, you are doing OK; if not, you have to adjust.
* **Make PowerPoint work for you**
* **Use questions well** Have prepared questions that you can ask to allow you to repeat and recap key points. This also helps add material to support the initial presentation.
* **Speak to the group** Focus on the happy people--focus on where the smiles are. Everyone in the room is still listening to us, even if they do not look like it. Those who aren't looking directly at us can still see with their peripheral vision. We cannot read the minds of the audience, even if we can guess at their body language.
* **Use the equipment like a pro** Be a professional and just get started; trust that it all works. (Particularly if you did a tech check.)
* **Be yourself** Don't claim ownership of unoriginal material.
* **Suggest, don't force** Everything a speaker presents is still just an idea/opinion/theory. People can always choose what to do with the information. Remember that no matter how knowledgeable we are, we do not know everything. Humility needs to be at the essence of why we teach, share, and educate our audiences. If we do not have the mindset to accept feedback, we will never improve.
* **Be humble** Be honest about our background, our area of study, our success. Being open about our qualifications and experience will allow us to be trusted by our audience. We can build a strong rapport by being specific in our knowledge and not trying to be the expert in all areas.
* **Always be patient with your crowd**
* **Speak well to everyone** Audiences want to be there; want to learn; deserve respect; deserve a professional presentation; is not our friend until we communicate well and make them one; is not an enemy until we disrespect them and make them one.
* **Keep your language G-rated**
* **Focus on the positive** Everything we say directs the audience's focus and attention. Do not say anything you do not want the audience to focus on.
* **Are you really that funny?** It is not the audience's fault if we are not funny.
* **Phones off**
* **Plant positive seeds**

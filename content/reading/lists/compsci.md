# Intermediate-level material

* [*The Algorithm Design Manual*](https://smile.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/), with [video lectures](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/videos/) from the author (Steven Skiena).
* [*How to Solve It*](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Solve-Mathematical-Princeton-Science/dp/069116407X/) by Polya, and there's a [modern edition](https://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-Heuristics-Zbigniew-Michalewicz/dp/3540224947) that's more expansive and detailed. Both should be read, front to back.
* *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (SICP): [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) and [MIT video lectures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/) or [Brian Harvey's SICP lectures, UCBerkeley 61A](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter). Mind-blowing concepts around code, data, and the malleability of the two that comes from spending time in a Lisp/Scheme.
    * [*Composing Programs*](https://composingprograms.com/), "in the tradition" of SICP but uses Python
    * [*How to Design Programs*](http://www.htdp.org/)

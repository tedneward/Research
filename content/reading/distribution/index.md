[The 2022 Turing Award](https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/03/25/the-2022-turing-award/): "Bob Metcalfe is the sole winner of the 2022 Turing Award. He keyed the development of Ethernet technology growing out of his PhD thesis while at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s. Previous recognitions of his work include the IEEE Medal of Honor and the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. Congrats Bob. If you wish to know the key to what he invented it was the insight: ***Listen before you talk.***"

# Part I: A Philosophical Introduction
1. Beyond the Cuckoo Clock
      * Man is a tool-using creature

      * First tools were extensions of our physical abilities

      * Medieval clock was first extension of our mind

      * Cuckoo clocks are analog computers--take input (swings of pendulum) and turn them into data (time representation)

      * Computers are digital computers, and infinitiely flexible (unike analog computers)

2. Is There an Aesthetic of Programming?
      * discussion of algorithms as aesthetics

3. The Ethical Quotient
      * ethical challenges: qualities of magnification, precision, alienation, believability, malleability of information, impermeability, and autonomy of operation

      * magnification: computers magnify our thought processes significantly, but have no conscience or controls beyond what we put on them

      * precision: instructions to a computer must be precise

      * alientation: computer isolates programmers and operators from the people affected by their actions/code. "Instead of seein the program as a real instrument affecting the lives of real people, programmers sometimes see it as a game, a challenge to their ingenuity. The alienating quality of the computer permits us to overlook the human consequences of a programming decision or error." This happens to users on the Internet as well.

      * believability: we believe the computer because it presents us with too much information to be able to effectively doubt any of it

      * malleability: data can change without us knowing it

      * impermeability: we cannot observe the computer, only its side effects and results

      * autonomy of operation: the computer is capable of acting without our intervention or supervision

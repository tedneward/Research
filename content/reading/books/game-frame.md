# Level One: Games as an antidote to boredom
Bordome is all common among people who have become disenchanted with “the system,” whether that system is their company, their school, or even their personal life.

**Lack of Volition:**  Volition is the will to do something; the motivation and internal drive to see it through. Any kind of proactive or ambitious behavior is evidence of strong volition. People who lack volition feel lost, bored, or disconnected from the task at hand. They can’t see why an activity or behavior is worthwhile. A lack of volition is defined by disinterest, low involvement, and arrested development. An individual lacking volition says, “I’m not going to do that. Why would I? What’s in it for me?”

**Lack of Faculty:** Faculty is the belief that we have the skills and tools to handle the challenges we’re facing; that we know how to begin and have the confidence to pursue our goals. People who lack faculty in a particular situation may feel that it’s too hard, or that it’s unclear what they need to do to succeed. A lack of faculty is defined by anxiety, submission, and ultimately, despair. An individual lacking faculty says, “I can’t do this. I’m not prepared. I don’t know how.”

## Proof is in the Pudding
Fortunately for us, one medium is designed to address these issues systemically: games. Games, in contrast to shallow rewards systems, are made up of activities that we genuinely like. The point is that playing games is satisfying in and of itself. Layering a rewards system over an existing experience doesn’t make us like it any better, it just encourages us to tolerate it. And yet, game-like rewards systems have become quite popular.

And yet, game-like rewards systems have become quite popular. ... But while simply pasting game mechanics—the ingredients that make games work—onto an existing system is great for short-term engagement, it will almost certainly lead to diminishing returns down the road. The core experience of an activity matters, and a veneer of gameplay isn’t going to change that.

## Learning Machines
Human beings are learning machines. A game, at its core, is a kind of structured learning environment. In games, we learn two important things: new skills and new information.

## That Learning Feeling
It’s hard to tell exactly when we’re learning. We have a sense that it’s happening, but it’s not a conscious process. We encounter something new, turn it over and over in our minds (or hands), and somehow, in the handling, it becomes our own. Mental connections are made, and we now possess something we didn’t before. Along the way, while we’re not aware of these connections being formed, we are aware of how we feel during this process. We feel riveted. We feel as if we’re “getting it.” We feel a sense of deep satisfaction.

Any new skill or nugget of information represents a puzzle to our brains, one we feel compelled to solve.

## Who's in Charge Here?
In games, we control the action by making our own decisions. Without our input, most games simply stop. This kind of autonomy is incredibly empowering stuff, and it’s something sorely missing from the average person’s day. Control represents both the freedom to act and interact with the system, as well as our ability to manipulate the world around us. 

(Montessori method: children are self-directed learners.)

Autonomy and control also play a role in creating a sense of self. A lack of control in any system creates frustration. Nothing is more bothersome than knowing what to do and not being able (or trusted) to do it.

## Good Systems Create Flow
Human beings achieve a state of optimal experience when our skills are continually in balance with the challenges we face. This means that as we progress in any activity, we should be challenged just beyond the level of our abilities. This way, we have to grow ever so slightly to succeed. With each burst of growth, we reach ever higher for the next level.

Flow activities induce a state of mind classified by enjoyment, loss of time perception, and a suspension of self. We find ourselves so engaged, so in the experience, that we lose track of everything around us. Afterward, we feel an intense sense of exhilaration and accomplishment—a deep satisfaction with ourselves. 

Great games of all kinds do an excellent job of structuring the grokking process. They provide us with what we crave: a set of escalating challenges, feedback on our progress, and the thrill of victory.

Some people do take low-challenge, low-control situations and turn them into wonderful experiences rich with engagement... by playing the unlikely role of game designer. If they happen to work the checkout counter as a cashier, they make a game of how many people they can get to smile, or how many sales they can complete in an hour. Every day they try to beat their record, and on days when they do, they up the ante. They *create* a satisfying and escalating challenge instead of waiting for one to be given to them, and this approach literally changes their lives.

## Everyday Heroes
A radical simplification of the hero’s journey goes something like this: a “chosen” individual is called to higher purpose, is mentored by a wise elder, embarks on a quest, faces many trials, appears to perish but is reborn, confronts his nemesis, and emerges victorious. One of the reasons that we love games is because they instantly place us on our own hero’s journey, and from the comfort (and safety) of our living room. There’s something tremendously satisfying about playing out an archetypal struggle in which each of us, for the duration of the game at least, is the chosen one. Unlike so many other settings where seemingly meaningless and repetitive tasks frustrate us, in games we are at one with our story.


# Level Two: Pervasivenes and Engagement of Games
(Part of the "why" of gamification: History of games; examples of how pervasive games are engaging us; etc)

# Level Three: The Neuroscience of Play (and Fun)
(Feeling good vs feeling motivated)

## What Drives Us
To truly understand the brain chemistry involved in gameplay (or cupcakes for that matter), we need to understand the neurological difference between pleasure and desire. From a neuroscientist’s perspective, these are two very different things. The terms *liking* and *wanting* describe the processes behind pleasure and desire.

According to Berridge, there are certain hedonic hotspots located in a small part of the brain known as the nucleus accumbens. When we receive a reward, opioids and other brain chemicals are released to these hotspots and interact with the neurons there to, in Berridge’s words, “generate a ‘liking’ reaction—a sort of pleasure gloss or varnish.” Experiences that are pleasurable trigger this pleasure circuitry, which in turn tells us, “Hey, that really hits the spot.” Liking, then, in Berridge’s terms, is another word for pleasure.

Wanting, on the other hand, is primarily fueled by the neurotransmitter dopamine. Once thought to be the brain’s primary pleasure drug, dopamine is now understood to be much more active in regulating desire and motivation. According to Steven Johnson in Everything Bad Is Good for You, “The dopamine system is a kind of accountant: keeping track of expected rewards, and sending off an alert—in the form of lowered dopamine levels—when those rewards don’t arrive as promised.” When we don’t find what we’re looking for, lowered dopamine levels trigger that wanting sensation—and an invigorated search for the reward we’re craving. Seeking, a concept originated by Washington State University neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp, is synonymous with wanting. Panksepp uses the term to describe an emotional state of “eagerness and directed purpose.” This concept of seeking in the brain was developed by Panksepp over the course of several decades spent researching emotional systems in mammals. Essentially, seeking represents our will to act; it explains our most innate drive—that is, the will to wake up every morning and forage for survival. This instinct is not irreversible. In studies where dopamine neurons are destroyed, starving lab rats presented with food won’t even take two steps to eat it, because their wanting system—their motivational circuitry—is no longer functioning. Provided that the rats’ pleasure and consummatory pathways are still intact though, these same immobilized rodents will eat if food is placed directly in their mouths. Wanting and liking form a kind of symbiotic loop of motivation and satisfaction. Wanting drives us to pursue the object of our desire. Once we get it, our liking circuits, and the consummatory acts that stimulate them, inhibit our need to seek. This state of satisfaction and calm lasts until these inhibitors wear off, and then we start all over again.

## Built to Play
If there’s a pattern to the rewards or surprises we encounter, our brain quickly recognizes it. Each time something good happens, neurons in our reward circuitry fire. Over time, though, a special group of prediction neurons start firing at the first sign that a reward is coming. The more these neurons fire together—the more repeatable the pattern—the more their synapses are strengthened. As they say, neurons that fire together wire together.

This hunt for patterns explains much about the gamer mindset, our Internet addiction, and flow. There is some evidence to suggest that our internal sense of time is also controlled by dopamine, which would explain why flow activities (including playing games) can create the illusion of time flying or standing still. The human brain is an unbelievably complex system that, for all our probing, still retains many mysteries. Even one small area, like the basal ganglia (which plays host to most of the phenomena we discussed here), operates through a tangled web of excitatory, inhibitory, and disinhibitory pathways across half a dozen functional parts. This stuff is anything but simple.

## Play is a State of Mind
Interestingly, we can come to an activity emotionally ready to play, but an activity also has the ability to prompt a play state in us. For example, try playing dodgeball with your co-workers and remaining even-tempered and unexcited. As students of human behavior, the notion that an activity or stimulus can trigger our natural play response is important, and we’ll come back to it later.

## Playing with Patterns
Play gives us a chance to hone what we do best (and what we most enjoy): noticing, deciphering, and mastering patterns.

## Play is Learning
When we play against obstacles, we make an assumption about what might work, and then test our hypothesis. In this way, all play is an active hunt for a pattern—a hands-on way to train our brains. The uncertainty, resistance, and difficulty we face in different kinds of play create a unique kind of tension. And it’s this force that pushes back against our desires and forces us to figure out a way to succeed.

Tension permeates the experience of “probing,” a concept that has been discussed by professor James Paul Gee (an expert on games and learning) and Steven Johnson. Probing is simply the act of exploring an environment or phenomenon we don’t understand in an orderly way. Gee’s account of the probing process, in which he describes players hypothesizing about and testing their virtual environments, sounds incredibly similar to the process we employ in scientific research. Could it be that play is simply an emotionally charged expression of the scientific method? If so, then probing is our most natural learning mechanism. Play isn’t a way to make learning fun ... play is learning.

## Play is Misunderstood
At some point in our past, we drew a line between work and play as if they were somehow exclusive concepts. Work is productive, play is frivolous. This may have been an important message when scolding factory workers during the Industrial Revolution, but it’s an inaccurate and counterproductive message today amidst the Digital Revolution. *Play is an abundant energy source that powers all human potential*. To tap into it, we need to define it, understand it, and respect it—all difficult activities in a culture that has relegated it to playgrounds and idle hands.

## Defining Play
"Summing up the formal characteristic of play, we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside “ordinary” life as being “not serious” but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings that tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress the difference from the common world by disguise or other means."

“Play is the free space of movement within a more rigid structure.”

## Putting the Fun in Play
Not surprisingly, play is fun. And fun is powerful. We all want to have it. If you think back to the best moments of your life, they will almost uniformly be defined by fun. ... We should consider fun as a means rather than an end. If that’s the case, then we should be able to have fun in a wide range of circumstances. We most certainly can. In fact, we need to. Dale Carnegie, in How to Win Friends and Influence People, says it all, “People rarely succeed at anything unless they have fun in what they are doing.”

## Fun is Nature's Reward
Evolutionary psychology tells us that having fun increases our chances of survival. In attempting to explain the joy of being chased in sports like football or tag, Boston College Professor Peter Gray recalls the work of Karl Groos, a naturalist, who wrote The Play of Animals in 1898. Groos posited that young mammals who engage in games of chase derive great joy from the activity because repeated games of chase will prepare them for fleeing from predators. ... fun is nature’s reward for practicing survival skills.

## Fun Can Be Hard
Hard fun suggests the distinction between fun as pleasure (a roller coaster ride), and fun as enjoyment (building a beautiful sand castle), in which the latter is clearly the hard fun. Hard fun has the potential to be infinitely more rewarding, and is the by-product of a well-designed game.

**Activity:** The activity in a behavioral game is the real-world endeavor that the game is built upon. Identifying an activity is as simple as finding an area of focus--something we want players to do more, better, or differently. Some good examples of activities include studying, exercising, cooking, painting, brainstorming, relaxing, and so on. Activities are verbs; they are the things we do.


**Player profile:** ... is a trait-baed description of the players in a behavioral game. Since we're attempting to influence specific players, the player profile offers us the information we need in the form of two key variables: drivers and symptoms. Drivers are psychological traits that help us understand which dynamics will motivate our players. [there are] four dyads against which players can be evaluated. Each one represents a continuum between two drivers that can increase or decrease volition and faculty. For the player profile we need to determine (by observation or inquiry) which end of the spectrum motivates our players most.

     * **Achievement** of goals vs. **Enjoyment** of experience
     * **Structure** and guidance vs **Freedom** to explore
     * **Control** of others vs. **Acceptance** of others
     * **Self-interest** in actions vs **Social interest** in actions

Achievement vs. enjoyment gets at the heart of how players evaluate an experience; is it the outcome or the process that matters?

Structure vs freedom tells us something about their learning style; do they want t master skills through instruction, or to figure things out for themselves?

Control vs. acceptance indicates how they define power; do they get it from dominion over others or from their connection to community?

Self-interest vs social-interest gives us clues about their idea of success; is it about their own progression, or overall progress?

Every player has a tendency toward one end of each dyad, and that tendency can inform the kind of dynamics we create in our behavior games. For instance, a player who prefers achievement and structure will probably respond quite wel to a competition with strict rules.


The other half of a player profile, the symptoms, are the topics of volition and faculty. A complete player profile will indicate whether one or both of these is a possible issue and how they are manifesting themselves. For example, a player low in faculty may appreciate a behavioral game with clear instructions and levels.


**Objectives:** are goals toward which effort is directed. There are two kinds of objectives in a behavioral game: short-term and long-term. A long-term goal is the ultimate objective, how we determine if and when the game has been won. Without a long-term goal, it would be unclear what we are trying to accomplish. Short-term goals are the things that must be accomplished along the way. In a complex game, they focus our efforts and give us a clear indication of what to do next. Success in short-term goals is both rewarding and motivating, and afterward players look confidently to the next challenge. In many cases where a behavior game is required, short-term and long-term objectives are not presently clear, and need to be made up together. A sound long-term goal should be an end-state desired by everyone involved: the players and the system in which they are playing. Beyond that, long-term goals have the potential to give players narrative context. If the ultimate objective is to put the competition out of business, then everything we do is in service of that rivalry.


**Skills:** are specialized abilities that we put to use in a behavioral game. By definition, skills are abilities that we can learn, and learning new skills os one of the most satisfying things that players can do. Skills come in many variations, but are easily divided into three categories: physical (skiing, running, using a chef's knife), mental (pattern recognition, memory, spatial logic) and social (presentation, conversations, and meeting new people). Behavioral game design requires that we're conscious of all three, and develop our chosen skills through play. What's more, behavioral game design ensures that the skills we develop in a game are useful and practical within the game itself--that in essence, improving our abilities unlocks features or experiences that we desire.


**Resistance:** is the force of opposition that creates tension in a behavioral game. One of the most counterintuitive things about games is that players don't like a sure thing. Playing a game we know we're going to win is no fun. To understand why, we have to recall that games are learning engines--not just pastimes--so what we expect from them above all is a chance to learn. Learning, by definition, is about growth. We grow by stretching our body and mind. If a game is guaranteed to go our way, then we don't need to stretch. We can simply watch things unfold. So then, behavioral games require some element of uncertainty to be engaging and to deliver on their promise. That uncertainty comes in many shapes and sizes, and is most aptly described as resistance. Two common forms of resistance are competition and chance. Competition pits players against one another, and chance subjects players to unpredictable circumstances. Every behavioral game has some form of resistance, and many variations of this important building block exist.


**Resources:** are the spaces and supplies that players use, or have the potential to acquire, in behavioral games. Traditional games often require material goods and spaces: pieces, cards, boards, courts, balls, ammunition, and anythign else required to play. Each of these objects has specific attributes (what it can do and what can be done with it) and states (active/inactive, etc). For our purposes, I've grouped all these necessary elements into the building block of resources. In a behavioral game focused on cooking, for example, resources might include a kitchen, kitchen utensils, a selection of ingredients, and recipe cards.


**Actions:** are the moves available to players in a behavioral game. This includes what they are allowed to do as well as the when, where, and how of those moves. Importantly, actions are inclusive of decisions and choices. In some games, simply making decisions is enough to propel the game along. In others, more active play is required. Actions are typically additive (do more work) which decisions can be additive or negative (decide to start or stop eating junk food). Actions influence the tone and style of a behavioral game, so we must choose them carefully.


**Feedback:** is a system response to a player's actions. Feedback comes in many different forms, ranging from data and information (such as a speedometer) to auditory stimulation (such as a room full of laughter). Without feedback, it would be completely unclear what effect (if any) our actions are having in a behavioral game. In this way, feedback is one of the broadest building blocks, representing every mechanism that can react to a player. Because feedback is our main method of evaluating our own performance, it has a strong relationship with our sense of faculty--if we're getting good feedback, we become more confident that we can achieve our objectives. Feedback can impact our sense of volition as well. If we experience a pattern of positive feedback, we often feel more motivated to continue. The feedback loop is a fundamental element in learning and making sense of hte world around us.


**Black Box:** is a rules engine within a behavioral game. Because behavioral games come in many forms, the black box could be a computer program or a document, or reside in the game designer's head. The important thing is that it contains all the information about the interplay between actions and feedback--a record of all possible if/then scenarios. The written instructions that come with a board game are a good example of this concept. In some behavioral games, the black box could be as simple as a few simple rules, in others, it could require serious technology. The Nike+ system illustrates the interplay between actions, feedback, and the black box nicely. In that system, the runner takes action by running at a certain pace. The system has the ability to provide feedback in the form of auditory encouragement, but the black box determines when it will actually play this audio.


**Outcomes:** are positive and negative results that occur while in pursuit of the ultimate objective in a behavioral game. Positive outcomes include tangible and intangible rewards such as moving up a level, while negative outcomes might be starting over or losing key resources. Outcomes are an important culmination of the more immediate feedback players have received, and mark a moment of relfection in any behavioral game.


## How to put it all together:
### Step one: Choose the Activity
Because we're focusing on practical applications of a game layer in our everyday lives, every behavioral game starts with an activity. The behavior you're trying to create is almost certainly related to an activity. Your job is to select that activity and design a game that will make it better. Remember, with behavioral games, it's not just what your players do, but how they do it.

Tips & tricks:

* Is a behavioral game really the best solution to your problem? If there is an easier or more direct way to tackle your issue, do it.
* Can the skills required by the activity be learned? If not, then a behavioral game won't help.
* Does the activity have the potential for long-term engagement? Are there professionals or "masters" in this field? The presence of experts indicates an area with plenty of room for growth.
* Find the fun. What aspects of the activity are inherently enjoyable when it's done right? Note these aspects now, so you can amplify them later.
* Find the boring. What aspects of the activity are inherently dull? Note these aspects as well, so you can work around them.


### Step two: Create the Player Profile
To create a player profile, you need to get to know your players. You can do this in any number of ways. Sometimes it makes sense to survey them and get their personal perspective. Other times, observation is enough. Interviewing the people they spend time with can also be extremely informative. AT the end of the day, you need to be able to answer two fundamental questions: First, what is holding your player from achieving their potential? Is it the aforementioned lack of faculty or volition? Second, what are the drivers that motivate them (see the dyads, above)?

Tips & tricks:

* Study your players' behavior during hte activity itself. What do they do naturally? Which ends of the dyads do they seem drawn to? What do they pull away from?
* If you happen to be designing a behavioral game for yourself, you can develop your player profile through self-report, but you'll get better results with honest input from friends, family, and colleagues.
* When designing for a large group, such as an office or university campus, assume that player profiles will map to a bell curve and focus on creating more broadly desirable game dynamics.


### Step three: Choose the Objectives
Remember the idea of the hero's journey? The objectives of a behavioral game are, in many ways, the basis of that quest. First off, your long-term goal must be compelling. Look at your activity and player profile, and consider the different sorts of ultimate objectives that might work. Remember, this could be the mastery of a skill, a new habit, an achievement, a title, or any other pinnacle of personal growth. Next, consider the short-term goals--the steps along the way. What must your players accomplish in order to reach the ultimate objective? How can you break the journey up into discrete and satisfying challenges that push your players and help them improve?

Tips & tricks:

* Behavioral games work best when the objectives align with the desires of the players. Find something that they want to accomplish and can get excited about.
* Remember that the ultimate objective should be fairly difficult to achieve--the learning curve required should be steep. Otherwise, you'll be designing the sequel sooner than you'd like
* Don't go with uninspired objectives just because they describe the outcomes you seek. Figure out a way to make long-term and short-term goals as exciting and aspirational as possible, given your constraints. Go for the glory.


### Step four: Choose the Skill(s)
Skills are the heart of any behavioral game, and they are improved through its play. To define the skills that will be the basis of a behavioral game, consider what abilities are necessary to suceed in the endeavor. The activity and the objectives are a good place to start. Make a skills list, including anything you can think of that is relevant to your game across all three categories of skills (physical, mental and social). Examples of skills include prediction, survival, collecting, curating, pattern recognition, endurance, time management, trading, racing and literally thousands of others. An interesting subset is "twitch" skills, which are very common in games. These include any reflex-driven activity, from skeet shooting to trivia. A simple behavioral game might be based on only one core skill, while the activity itself involves several other skills that are not measured within the game. This is okay. Your design determines what skills are the focus. A more complex behavioral game may include three or more skills. Remember, though, the more skills you include, the more complex your design will have to be to accommodate them.

Tips & tricks:

* Consider what skills are already in your players' repertoire. Starting out wiht an existing but unmastered skill can help make players feel confident and increase faculty.
* If possible, identify a core skill that can act as the main method of interaction within the game. A simple but infinitely evolvable skill is a powerful thing, and worth searching for. 
* With a list of possible skills in hand, rank them in terms of difficulty, complexity, and how natural they are for your players. This will help you narrow the field.
* Choose skills that have long learning curves and can be developed over longer time frames. Flipping a light switch at an expert level is fairly quickly achieved, while navigating by the stars is a lifelong pursuit.
* For longer/richer games, consider how skills can be broken down into smaller and more manageable subskills. Thin about how to nest them, one inside the other, adding up to something complex.
* Are the skills you're considering measurable? How might you make them measurable? This often requires the use of new technology or active monitoring.


### Step five: Choose the Resistance
Good games are inherently uncertain. As a behavioral game designer, you get to determine what kind of uncertainty your players will have to overcome. Remember, resistance is a balancing act. You're trying to create an experience that keeps players in a state of flow, where their skills and the challenges they face are matched--stretching them just enough to develop those skills and learn something new. Too much resistance, and the game is frustrating and disheartening. Too little, and it's boring. Because resistance is an overarching part of the experience, it often interacts with other building blocks to serve its purpose. For example, a game may use scarcity (a form of resistance) to limit the resources available to players. Because of this, designing the resistance in a behavioral game is one of the most difficult and sophisticated parts of the process. The tension that a behavioral game creates, and the relief that comes from conquering that resistance, is the delicate dance you must orchestrate.

Tips & tricks:

* Be creative. Imagine as many forms of resistance as you can and then determine which ones would lead t the best gameplay. Scarcity, chance, and puzzles are just a few popular forms of resistance.
* Simple forms of resistance can create incredibly complex games. Don't try to make things too clever.
* Forced decisions that involve tradeoffs or comparisons can be a very effective form of resistance (if you do "x", you lose "y").
* In the same way we looked for skills that were expandable and long-term, consider forms of resistance that have equally long lives. If resistance can be grokked and overcome too quickly, it won't provide much uncertainty or engagement.


### Step six: Choose the Resources
Every game requires certain supplies in order to be played, and other optional resources can make things even more interesting. The options for action available to players increase in proportion to the resources available to them. Playing soccer with three balls would radically alter the choices available to the players. To choose the resources for your behavioral game, think about the basic supplies required for the activity you've chosen. Are they all necessary to build the skills you selected? Are there any you can take away? Build a basic supplies list. Next, think about what could help your players along in their quest. What would introduce new dynamics into the game? What would appeal to their player profile?

Tips & tricks:

* Don't take anything for granted. Consider every possible resource that is involved in the activity. Examine the impact of each on the overall experience.
* Consider which existing resources are helping or hindering your players' progress. Make adjustments accordingly.
* When inventing new resources to add into the mix, think about how they'll involve and interact with your other building blocks.
* Remember, not every behavioral game needs new resources. Sometimes the basics are enough. Start by limiting resources (and letting players earn them back) before you jump to add more.


### Step seven: Define the Skill Cycle(s)
For players to learn or improve a skill in a behavioral game, that skill needs to be put into practice. Skill cycles are the way we accomplish this--an articulation of what it means to actually play the game. A skill cycle is much like a "round" in a normal game, and it's made up of all the central building blocks in the Game Frame: actions, black box, feedback, skills, resources, and resistance.

A skill cycle is one "period" during which actions are taken and feedback is delivered. Depending on the nature of the activity, this period could last one minute or one month. Ideally, a skill cycle should adopt the interval that best demonstrates the skill put to good use. In specifying a skill cycle, you are essentially explaining the "rules of play" to your players, which is why this step is most heavily related to the black box. The skill cycle is the general outline of how the game is played, what options for action are available to them, and what feedback they'll receive. The feedback that is provided must be tailored to the challenge at hand. A chef preparing a meal likely doesn't need feedback on average knife speed, but could definitely use a temperature readout on the stove. In a behavioral game where a desired action is arriving to work on time, the designer will have to account for how to respond to someone being late. In order to make sure a behavioral game achieves its purpose, defining a skill cycle for every chosen skill in the game is recommended.

Tips & tricks:

* Consider what skills are being mastered through the course of your game, and how to combine them with new ones to keep things fresh.
* Make sure the actions available to your players directly affect their progress in the game
* Remember, a wider variety of available actions will make players feel more autonomous, but can also complicate things quickly.
* Options for action should be abundantly clear. Make sure your players know the moves available to them (unless you're purposefully trying to get them to explore their options as a form of resistance).
* Make sure that your skill cycles have an obvious beginning and end, whether that be time-based (daily, weekly, monthly) or action-based (every ten swings).
* Think about your skill cycle. Does it provide a steady stream of escalating challenge? What could change between cycles to ensure that?
* Watch for skills that are getting burned out or are no longer satisfying to use, and remember to increase resistance or combine them with newer skills to keep players engaged.
* The more specific the actions in your skill cycle are, the more specific your feedback should be.
* Know your black box and the rules governed by it. You should have a specific form of feedback in mind for every possible action (including inaction).


### Step eight: Choose the Outcomes
Every game has outcomes that occur en route to victory. The ultimate objective may take weeks, months, or even years to achieve, but along the way, players need to see and feel incremental successes and failures. Outcomes allow this. In terms of design, outcomes are related to short-term goals. If a short-term goal is accomplished or an opportunity missed, an outcome can drive the learning home. In many cases, outcomes take the form of rewards (tangible or intangible), but outcomes can actually be positive or negative. Our players may experience setbacks in their quest; sometimes they'll have to press reset and start over. If all the outcomes in a behavioral game are positive, uncertainty goes down (and takes learning with it).

Tips & tricks:
* Remember that outcomes can be contingent or scheduled. Players can trigger an outcome based on a specific action they take, or a time frame within the game.
* Outcomes can occur based on ratios (a number of specific actions) and intervals (a unit of time) between outcomes.
* Remember what you learned from operant conditioning about rewards schedules: if they are variable/unpredictable you'll get a more active response as players try to grok the system.


### Step nine: Play-test and Polish
With the pieces of your behavioral game now in place, it's time to put it through the paces. What's working about it? What isn't? What are the risks if it backfires? What's going to keep it interesting in ten weeks' time? What have you not considered? Remember, your goal here is an elegant and engaging structured learning experience. When done right, radically simple or embedded behavioral games may be so natural and fluid that your players don't even know they're playing. They may simply assume that "this is the way things work", or be sucked in by a particularly engaging skill cycle, and never question why. The military, which benefits from many game mechanics, is a perfect example of this.

Tips & tricks:

* Lower the barriers to entry--make it as easy as possible to play. The more a game asks of players in the beginning, the less likely they are to engage.
* Ensure that novelty has been built into the process across the board. A good behavioral game should be full of surprises and new things to grok.
* Add and subtract from your building blocks to see what happens to the experience.
* Make sure the overall game experience is not too hard. Players thrive on repeated success, and the progress that it implies.
* Consider the role of technology in your behavioral game. How would the experience differ if you used more or less technology to enable feedback?
* Is the game personal enough for your players? Do they feel that it's tailored to their own unique personality and desires?
* Remember, above all, your work as a designer is never done. Keep raising the stakes. When your players reach their objectives, it's time to go back to the drawing board!

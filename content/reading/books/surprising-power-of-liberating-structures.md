## Prologue
The purpose of this book is to greatly expand your alphabet of possible ways to interact and work with others to achieve exceptional results. It describes and explains thirty-three new “letters,” simple methods that you can learn without difficulty, with only a small amount of practice.

These so-called Liberating Structures make it easy to transform how people interact and work together in order to achieve much better results than what is possible with presentations, reports, and other conventional methods. We call them Liberating Structures because they are designed to include and engage everybody. They “liberate,” so to speak, everybody’s contribution to the group’s success. How well you interact and work with other people often determines not only your success at work but also in other areas of your life. You will find that each Liberating Structure has its own specific benefits. By learning to use some or all of them, you will create your own alphabet and build a different vocabulary for getting things done with others. Your new language will be endlessly adaptable and applicable as you create more combinations to fit every situation that you face in your life, whether challenge or opportunity, large or small, simple or complex.

### Chapter 1: Small Changes, Big Differences
Small changes in people’s routine practices produced big differences in the results they were getting.

**The Invitation**: Check all that apply when you think about a group or organization you work with:

* Deadly boring or frustrating meetings 
* Someone else’s best practices imposed 
* Deciders separated from the doers 
* Brain-numbing PowerPoint presentations 
* Difficult conversations routinely avoided 
* Fear and politics getting in the way 
* Teamwork that feels like drudgery 
* Group process that is chaotic 
* More training but no changes 
* Great ideas that never leave the drawing board 
* People excluded because they would “complicate” decisions 
* Structural changes that don’t deliver the Promised Land 
* Being expected to know and anticipate everything 
* Change driven by resorting to fear or “bribery” 
* More and more bureaucracy and requests for data
* Accountability without adequate autonomy and support 
* Things that everybody knows don’t work but are never changed

At the core of the book is the practical idea that simple shifts in our routine patterns of interaction make it possible for everyone to be included, engaged, and unleashed in solving problems, driving innovation, and achieving extraordinary outcomes. Small changes generate big results without imported best practices, more training, or expensive buy-in strategies. This alternative approach is both practical and feasible because, as you will see, Liberating Structures are quite simple and easy to learn; they can be used by everyone at every level, from the C-suite to the front line of any organization, from the neighborhood block club to the global issue-advocacy association. Rather than complicated frameworks or elaborate processes to guide work together, Liberating Structures employ simple rules that are extremely spare and very specific.

**What's Ahead**: 

We believe Liberating Structures are transformational because they are purposely designed to make it easy to accomplish what is missing in most organizations, namely to include and engage people effectively and to unleash their collective intelligence and creativity. They provide a wide variety of ways to:

* Accommodate groups of any size 
* Let go of control safely 
* Give everyone equal opportunity to contribute 
* Facilitate progress through rapid sifting and sequencing 
* Maximize active participation 
* Routinely generate better-than-expected results

### Chapter 2: Why Microstructures Matter 
*(How invisible structures shape everything that gets done)*

Whatever we do, there is always a structure to support or guide what is being done. Without structures, there is just chaos. people. All sorts of structures shape all our undertakings and accomplishments, and we will explain how and why.

#### First, a Few Definitions

* **macrostructures**: Buildings, strategies, policies, organization structures, and core operating processes are examples of what we call macrostructures. They are built or designed for the long term and can’t be changed easily or cheaply. 

* **microstructures**: In contrast, meeting rooms, offices, presentations, agendas, questions, and discussions are examples of microstructures. They are the small structures that we select routinely to help us interact or work with other people. They can be changed easily from one event to another or even in the moment.
    * **Tangible microstructures** are the physical spaces where interactions or work takes place. They are like the room where the family eats dinner. They also include how we choose to arrange the tangible **structural elements** within that space, such as tables, chairs, flip charts, and the like.
    * **Intangible microstructures** are how we micro-organize our interactions with elements such as agendas, presentations, processes, discussions, questions, seating arrangements, and so forth.

**Hierarchy and Examples of Structures**
               |Tangible Structures|Intangible Structures
---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------
**Macrostructures**|Office building; school; Hospital; Shop; Ship; Factory|Strategies; Organization Structure; Policies and Procedures; Compensation/Incentives; Core operating processes; Grants of authority
**Microstructures**|Boardroom; Classroom; Meeting room; Restaurant; Office; Water cooler|Presentation/Lecture; Managed discussion; Status report; Open discussion; Brainstorm; Liberating Structure
**Structural Elements**|Large round table; Large rectangular table; Small table; Chair; Flip chart; Post-its; Projector; Screen|Purpose/Agenda; Question; Theme; Seating arrangement; Group configuration; Time allocation; Standing instead of sitting; Formal or informal

Microstructures may sound like small things, but they have a big impact.

#### The Neglected Power of Microstructures

*People, supported by resources and macrostructures, make decisions and take actions that generate results.*

#### Microstructures Enable and Constrain

Microstructures are the way you organize all your routine interactions, consciously or not. They guide and control how groups work together. They shape your conversations and meetings. They enable and constrain what is possible. 

For our purposes, we can say they come in two flavors: conventional microstructures and Liberating Structures.

Conventional microstructures, in one form or another, have been around for centuries. They are designed for convincing, teaching, debating, brainstorming, controlling, or some combination of these purposes. Their usefulness, however, is limited by side effects that are difficult or impossible to avoid, such as unengaged participants or audiences, excessive power dynamics, and competition for attention, bodies present but minds absent. The resulting frustrations spark much talk about the need for engaging employees (in academia, the talk is about engaging students), but, in actual practice, there is too little expertise on how to engage people effectively and broadly. **The standard decision-making formula is: meet with a small circle of coworkers, decide, and then tell the others.** The Big Five: The presentation, the managed discussion, the status report, the open discussion, and the brainstorm.

The impact of the conventional microstructures is greatly dependent on the skills and personalities of their users. The reason is that, as structures go, they are either too tight or too loose in terms of how much control is exerted on the participant group. Each of these qualities—too tight or too loose—has its limitations. What’s more, all conventional microstructures make it impossible to engage more than a small number of participants.

#### Elements of Control

All microstructures are made up of the same five structural elements. These elements determine how control is exercised over a group of people who are working together: 

* **The invitation** 
  Provides direction in the form of a question or a request. In other words, participation in the group’s work together will depend on someone’s invitation, explicit or implicit, to listen or speak up, to contribute to an objective, and so on.

* **How space is arranged and what materials are used** 
  All the choices that can be made about the tangible and intangible elements such as tables, chairs, podiums, projectors, flip charts, where people are located, whether they are standing up or sitting down. These arrangements can contribute to the invitation but often conflict with it as, for example, when a large group is sitting classroom-style and people are invited to ask questions.

* **How participation is distributed among participants**
  How much time every participant will be given to contribute.

* **How groups are configured**
  The freedom that exists to change the composition of a group—for instance, by breaking up into small groups then reconfiguring into another formation.

* **The sequence of steps and the time allocated to each step**
  Every microstructure contains one or more steps, each with a specific purpose and time allocation.

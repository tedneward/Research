# Basics of the UNIX Philosophy
**Rule of Modularity**: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces

**Rule of Clarity**: Clarity is better than cleverness

**Rule of Composition**: Design programs to be connected with other programs

**Rule of Separation**: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines

**Rule of Simplicity**: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must

**Rule of Parsimony**: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do

**Rule of Transparency**: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier

**Rule of Robustness**: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity

**Rule of Representation**: Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust

**Rule of Least Surprise**: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing

**Rule of Silence**: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing

**Rule of Repair**: Repair what you can--but when you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible

**Rule of Economy**: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time

**Rule of Generation**: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can

**Rule of Optimization**: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it

**Rule of Diversity**: Distrust all claims for "one true way"

**Rule of Extensibility**: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think

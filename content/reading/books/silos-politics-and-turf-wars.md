## The Theory

### Introduction to Silos
Silos are nothing more than the barriers that exist between departments within an organization, causing people who are supposed to be on the same team to work against one another. ... In most situations, silos rise up not because of what executives are doing purposefully but rather because of what they are failing to do: provide themselves and their employees with a compelling context for working together. This notion of context is critical. Without it, employees at all levels—especially executives—easily get lost, moving in different directions, often at cross-purposes.

Most employees have a profound and genuine interest in working well across divisions. That’s because they, more than anyone else, feel the daily pain of departmental politics as they are left to fight bloody, unwinnable battles with their colleagues. If there is a place where the blame for silos and politics belongs, it is at the top of an organization. Every departmental silo in any company can ultimately be traced back to the leaders of those departments, who have failed to understand the interdependencies that must exist among the executive team, or who have failed to make those interdependencies clear to the people deeper in their own departments.

### Components of the Model
The model for combating silos consists of four components:

* **A thematic goal**: *A single, qualitative focus that is shared by the entire leadership team.* It applies for only a specified time period. A thematic goal is not a long-term vision or a BHAG (big hairy audacious goal). Nor is it a tactical metric or measurable objective. While it is certainly a good idea for companies to have both a vision to motivate people over the long term and a set of tactical objectives to guide their daily activities—and most do—the thematic goal lies somewhere in between the two, and I believe it may well be even more important. That’s because it bridges the two by making the vision more tangible and by giving the tactical objectives more context. 

    * *Single*: organization, there can be only one true thematic goal in a given period.

    * *Qualitative*: The thematic goal is not a number, and it is not even specifically measurable. It is a general statement of a desired accomplishment. It requires a verb, because it rallies people to do something. Improve, reduce, increase, grow, change, establish, eliminate, accelerate.

    * *Time-Bound*: The thematic goal does not live beyond a fixed time period, because that would suggest that it is an ongoing objective. To the contrary, it is a desired achievement that is particularly important during that period, and must therefore be accomplished in a corresponding time frame.

    * *Shared*: The thematic goal applies to everyone on the leadership team, regardless of their area of expertise or interest. While it is true that some thematic goals will naturally fit largely within one particular executive’s area of responsibility, it is critical that all team members take responsibility for the goal, and for doing anything they can to move the company—not just their own department—toward the accomplishment of that goal.

* **A set of defining objectives**: *The temporary, qualitative components of the thematic goal; shared by all members of the leadership team.* Once a thematic goal has been set, a leadership team must then give it actionable context so that members of the team know what must be done to accomplish the goal. Like the thematic goal, defining objectives are *qualitative* and *shared* across the entire team.
    * *Qualitative*: Executives are often tempted to overquantify defining objectives because it gives them a sense of closure and certainty, especially after struggling with the notion that the thematic goal was not quantified.

    * *Shared*: Even though a defining objective seems to be geared specifically to the member of the leadership team with functional expertise in that area, it is critical that all leaders assume a very real sense of accountability and responsibility for achieving it. And even executives with little or no technical knowledge about that objective can and must play a critical role in ensuring that every angle is explored and every distraction is avoided.

    * *Time-Bound*: When the thematic goal is no longer valid, the defining objectives also change.

* **A set of ongoing standard operating objectives**: *The ongoing priorities of the organization; shared by all members of the leadership team (and usually varying in number from four to six).* Standard operating objectives often include topics like revenue and expenses, as well as other items like customer satisfaction, productivity, market share, quality, and the like. The danger for a company lies in mistaking one of these critical objectives, like revenue or expenses, for a rallying cry. Most employees find it difficult to rally around “making the numbers” or “managing expenses,” knowing that these will continue to be trumpeted as critical over and over again in future periods. When leaders use these standard operating objectives as rallying cries, they create a “boy who cried wolf” syndrome, provoking cynicism and lethargy among employees who say, “Here we go again with the ‘increase revenue’ plea.”

* **Metrics**: Once the thematic goal, defining objectives, and standard operating objectives have been established, a leadership team can now start talking about measurement.

### Identifying a Thematic Goal
At first glance, deciding on a thematic goal can sometimes seem difficult. The key to finding the right one is to let a team discuss it for a while, without feeling the need to arrive at a quick decision. Oftentimes, a team’s initial guess at a thematic goal will actually be one of the defining objectives that create the context for the goal. ... So be patient and constantly ask the question, “is this really the thematic goal, or is it merely one of many defining objectives?” If you’re still having a hard time identifying the thematic goal, you might be overthinking it. Often the thematic goal is deceptively simple.

### Managing and Organizing Around the Thematic Goal
Once a leadership team determines its thematic goal, defining objectives, and standard operating objectives, it needs to keep that information alive in the course of running the organization. And the place where it needs to be reviewed and discussed is during regular (usually weekly) staff meetings. First, go around the table and give every member of the team thirty seconds to report on their three top priorities for the coming week. Even a team of twelve can do this in six minutes. Then review your team scorecard, which is nothing more than a to-be-graded list of the items that make up the defining objectives and the standard operating objectives. Once the ratings have been done—and again, this usually takes five minutes—the team is ready to decide where to spend the time and energy available during the remainder of the meeting. And this would be the time for someone to challenge a teammate who is planning to spend a good chunk of time that week on an issue that is either disconnected from the thematic goal or related to an area that is already doing well.

All too often, executives spread their time evenly across all departments and issues, giving equal attention to every topic regardless of where it falls in terms of importance or progress. Meetings become show-and-tell sessions designed to give everyone time to talk about their departments and activities. This only reinforces silos and makes it more likely that critical issues get too little attention from the entire team.

### Thematic Goals and Long-Term Context
When a thematic goal runs its course and is largely accomplished, an organization must then come up with another, and then another. This raises the question, Shouldn’t all of this be part of a longer-term strategic direction? The answer is yes, but with some important caveats.

Too often, leaders of organizations choose one of two extremes when it comes to planning.
* They have no real long-range plan and make decisions reactively according to their short-term needs.
* They have a detailed and analytically elegant three- or five-year strategic plan, which is designed to eventually roll up into a grand, all-consuming long-term goal.

Successful organizations achieve a delicate balance between predicting what is going to happen over the long term and responding to unexpected circumstances along the way. This calls for a planning approach that provides the right amount of context without unnecessary restrictions. A thematic goal provides context because it exists within the framework of six to twelve months, a time horizon that most businesses can accurately manage. Beyond that, organizations find that their plans become irrelevant or stale. Shorter-term goals, on the other hand, the kind measured in days or weeks, don’t provide enough time for leaders and their employees to get their hands around something difficult.

As for BHAGs, every organization should probably have them. But they don’t provide enough guidance about what people should actually focus on once they get to work.

When a thematic goal is clearly established and communicated, employees should be able to look up from their work at any given time and see how they’re contributing to an outcome that is far enough away to give them the ability to succeed, but not so far away that they cannot imagine ever being finished. They should be able to see how the company’s long-term vision connects to its short-term objectives.

### Making Matrix Organizations Work
Matrix organizations have certainly not contributed to the breakdown of silos; they’ve merely added an element of schizophrenia and cognitive dissonance for employees who are unlucky enough to report into two different silos. But the matrix is here to stay, and so it is critical that we understand how to make thematic goals work within it. Happily, it turns out that a thematic goal is exactly what is needed to transform a matrix reporting structure from a tool of confusion to one of collaboration.

### Getting Started
The first step a leadership team needs to take toward establishing a thematic goal and identifying its related components is to carve out enough time to discuss the organization’s priorities. In some cases, a team will have to go back and clarify its overall purpose and strategy ahead of time in order to provide the context for identifying the thematic goal. (Don't skimp on time--full day, or even two days.)

[25 years of Personal Knowledge Management](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2022-04-03-25-years-of-personal-knowledge-management):

* Choose a single source of truth for information
* Choose a single source of truth for data (preferably on a device you own such as a NAS)
* Use a common structure across data types and silos (e.g., the PARA method) to find your way more easily
* Use consistent naming conventions and automate what you can. If you don't, you might go nuts
* Reduce the number of storage locations
* Reduce the number of tools you use for the same purpose to 1 if you can
* Rely on Open Source software whenever you can
* Rely on open data formats whenever you can
* Synchronize files across devices using automated tools; don't duplicate stuff manually
* Keep source data whenever possible
* Work on copies ONLY after making copies/backups of the original
* Use a single inbox for each type of data (e.g., an inbox for videos to process/sort)
* Apply the Zero Inbox principle (GTD) on all your inboxes
* Be serious about backups (gentle reminder: RAID is NOT a backup solution!)
* Avoid hoarding tons of content if you can. Dealing with huge amounts of data can hurt your mental health
* Learn to let go of the past (the sooner the better)

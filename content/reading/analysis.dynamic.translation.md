	- "in this dissertation we first present a novel machine emulator design based on dynamic binary translation that makes the following improvements over the state of the art: it scales on multicore hosts while remaining memory efficient, correctly handles cross-ISA differences in atomic instruction semantics, leverages the host floating point (FP) unit to speed up FP emulation without sacrificing correctness, and can be efficiently instrumented to---among other possible uses---drive the execution of a full-system, cross-ISA simulator with support for accelerators."

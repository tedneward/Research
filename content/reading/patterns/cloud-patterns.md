* **Data Management**: Data management is the key element of cloud applications, and influences most of the quality attributes. Data is typically hosted in different locations and across multiple servers for reasons such as performance, scalability or availability, and this can present a range of challenges. For example, data consistency must be maintained, and data will typically need to be synchronized across different locations.
* **Design and Implementation**: Good design encompasses factors such as consistency and coherence in component design and deployment, maintainability to simplify administration and development, and reusability to allow components and subsystems to be used in other applications and in other scenarios. Decisions made during the design and implementation phase have a huge impact on the quality and the total cost of ownership of cloud hosted applications and services.
* **Messaging**: The distributed nature of cloud applications requires a messaging infrastructure that connects the components and services, ideally in a loosely coupled manner in order to maximize scalability. Asynchronous messaging is widely used, and provides many benefits, but also brings challenges such as the ordering of messages, poison message management, idempotency, and more.
* **Operational Excellence**: Cloud applications run in a remote datacenter where you do not have full control of the infrastructure or, in some cases, the operating system. This can make management and monitoring more difficult than an on-premises deployment. Applications must expose runtime information that administrators and operators can use to manage and monitor the system, as well as supporting changing business requirements and customization without requiring the application to be stopped or redeployed.
* **Performance Efficiency**: Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. You need to anticipate these increases to meet business requirements. An important consideration in achieving performance efficiency is to consider how your application scales and to implement PaaS offerings that have built-in scaling operations. Scalability is ability of a system either to handle increases in load without impact on performance or for the available resources to be readily increased. It concerns not just compute instances, but other elements such as data storage, messaging infrastructure, and more.
* **Reliability**: Availability is measured as a percentage of uptime, and defines the proportion of time that a system is functional and working. Availability is affected by system errors, infrastructure problems, malicious attacks, and system load. Cloud applications typically provide users with a service level agreement (SLA), which means that applications must be designed and implemented to maximize availability.
* **Security**: Security provides confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances against malicious attacks on information systems (and safety assurances for attacks on operational technology systems). Losing these assurances can negatively impact your business operations and revenue, as well as your organization’s reputation in the marketplace. Maintaining security requires following well-established practices (security hygiene) and being vigilant to detect and rapidly remediate vulnerabilities and active attacks.

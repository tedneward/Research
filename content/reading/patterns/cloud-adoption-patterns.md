This set of patterns is intended for use by Architects, Lead Developers or Senior Developers who are thinking about adopting the cloud, especially as they evolve toward a cloud-native architecture in their projects. It is intended to provide guidance on how cloud-native applications should be designed, how they fit into a larger architectural picture, and how they can be built to operate efficiently. This version specifically addresses issues of systems design, microservices design and microservices efficiency, security and development process. They are currently being evolved, but we have developed at least a basic point of view on each section.

# 1. Today: Welcome to the Platform Revolution

***Platform***: "A business based on enabling value-creating interactions between external producers and consumers. Platform provides open, participative infrastructure for these interactions and sets governance conditions for them. Purpose: to consummate matches among users and facilitate the exchange of goods, services, or social currency, thereby enabling value creation for all participants."

Traditional system: pipeline/linear value chain (single-track, assembly line)

Platforms beat pipelines because platforms scale more efficiently by eliminating gatekeepers. Until recently, most business were built around products--designed/made at one end of the pipeline and delivered to consumers at the other end. Pipelines rely on inefficient gatekeepers to manage the flow of value from the producer to the consumer; the elimination of gatekeepers allow consumers greater freedom to select products that fit their needs.

***Platforms beat pipelines because platforms unlock new sources of value creation and supply.***

***Platforms beat pipelines by using data-based tools to create community feedback loops.***

***Platforms invert the firm.*** Strategy has moved from controlling the unique resources and erecting competitive barriers to orchestrating external resources and engaging vibrant communities.

# 2. Network Effects: The Power of the Platform
(Uber as a "matching"--matching ride-providers to ride-seekers--service)

Network effects: the impact the number of users of a platform has on the value created for each user.

Positive network effects: the ability of a large, well-managed platform community to produce significant value for each user of the platform

Negative network effects: the ability to reduce value for each user

Uber's "virtuous circle" (flowing clockwise)

```
Lower prices  ---> More demand \
  ^    ^                        \
  |     \                   More drivers
  |     Faster pickups          /
  |              ^             /
  |               \           /
  |                 ----  More geographic
  |               /       coverage/saturation
  |              v
Less driver downtime

(More demand -> More drivers -> More geographic coverage/satuation -> Faster pickups and Less driver downtime -> Lower prices -> More demand....)
```

***Demand economies of scale***
20th-century monopolies were created based on supply-side economies of scale, driven by production efficiencies, which reduce unit cost of good/service delivered. 21st-century driven by demand economies of scale, which take advantage of technology improvements on the demand side--efficiencies in social networks, demand aggregation, app development, and other phenomena that make bigger networks more valuable to users. (Metcalfe's Law: The value of a telephone network.)

***Two-sided network effects***
(The cycle--both sides of the market are engaged.)

***Network effects vs other growth-building tools***
Price effects are evanescent: they disappear the moment the discounts end or another firm offers a better price. Typically only 1-2% convert.
Brand effects are stickier, but difficult to sustain.
Virality effects attract, but network effects keep people there.

***Scaling network effects: Frictionless entry (and other tools)***
Effective platforms are able to expand in size quickly and easily, thereby scaling the value that derives from network effects. Netorks that permit frictionless entry are able to grow organically without limits.
Sideswitching: when users of one side of the platform can join the opposite side.

***Negative network effects***
Growth adds to difficulty of finding matches; offset by curation.
Data-driven network effects

***Four kinds of network effects***
Two-by-two grid of "same-side/cross-side" and "positive/negative" network effects:
Same-side positive network effects
Same-side negative network effects
Cross-side positive network effects
Cross-side negative network effects

***Structural change: Network effects turn firms inside out***
Four broad categories of companies:

* Asset builders
* Service providers
* Technology creators (develop/sell intellectural property)
* Network orchestrators (develop networks)

In the world of network effects, ecosystems of users are the new source of competitive advantage/market dominance.

# 3. Architecture: Principles for Designing a Successful Platform
A platform connects producers w/consumers and allows them to exchange value, one of 3 things:

* Information
* Goods/services
* Currency

***The core interaction: The Way of Platform Design***
3 key components:

* Particpants: Producer creates value, consumer consumes it
* Value unit: users are provided w/basis for deciding whether they want to proceed to further exchange
* Filter: Software-based tool used by the platform to enable the exchange of appropriate value units between users

> When designing a platform, your first and most important job is to decide what your core interaction will be, then define the participants, the value units, and the filters to make sure such core interaction is possible.

> Platforms don't create value units--they are created by the producers in the platform; thus the platforms are "information factories" that have no control over inventory. They create the 'factory floor'; they can foster a culture of quality control, and they develop filters that are designed to deliver valuable units while blocking others, but they have no control over the production process itself.

***Pull, facilitate, match: The How of Platform Design***

- Pull producers/consumers to the paltform
- Facilitate their interactions by providing tools/rules that make it easy for them to connect & enhance
- Match producers and consumers effectively by using info about each to connect them in ways they will find mutually rewarding

Pull challenges:

- attracting users
- keeping the interest of users
- tool: feedback loop(s): single-user and multi-user

***Behind the core interaction***
Successful platforms tend to scale by layering new inteactions on top of the core interaction

- by changing the value unit exchanged between existing users
- by introducing a new category of users as either producers or consumers
- by allowing users to exchange new kinds of value units
- by curating membrs of an existing user group to create a new category of users

***Applying the end-to-end principle to platform design***
End-to-End Principle: in a general-purpose network, application-specific functions out to reside in the end hosts of a network rather than in intermediary nodes. Only the highest-volume, highest-value features that cut across apps should become part of the core platform.

- When specific new features are incorporated into the core platform, apps that don't use them appear slow/inefficient; when app-specific features are run by an app itself, UX is cleaner
- Platform ecosystem can evolve faster when the core platform is a clean, simple system; stable core restricting variety, but underneath an evolving layer that enables variety

***Tower of Modularity***
Successful platform must have a modular approach; "designers achieve modularity by partitioning information into visible design rules and hidden design parameters; modularity is beneficial only if the partition is precide, unambiguous, and complete." ... "Fundamental architecture behind all systems is ... the system is partitioned into a set of 'core' components w/low variety and a complementary set of 'peripheral' components w/high variety. The low-variety components consititute the platform. They are the long-lived elements of the system and thus implicitly/explicitly establish the system's interfaces and the rules governing interactions among the parts."

***Re-architecting the platform***
First step: analyze the degree of modularity already achieved.

***Iterative improvement: The Anti-Design principle***
Platforms cannot be entirely planned--they also emerge; platforms characterized by activity controlled by the users, not bythe owners/managers. Platform designers should always leave room for serendipitous discoveries, as suers often lead the way to where design should evolve. Close monitoring of user behavior reveals unexpected patterns, some of which may suggest fruitful new ideas for value creation. Best platforms allow for user quirks & are open enough to gradually incorporate such quirks.

# 4. Disruption: How Platforms Conquer and Transform Traditional Industries
Platform concept is not new--farmer's markets, stock markets, etc. What's new is digital technology enabling reach.

***Capsule history of digitial disruption***
Stage 1: Efficient pipelines are inefficient pipelines
Stage 2: Platforms eat pipelines
In the world of platforms, the internet no longer acts merely as a distribution channel; it also acts as a creation infrstructure & coordination mechanism

***Impacts of platform distribution on value creation, value consumption, and quality control***
Reconfiguring value creation to tape new supply sources
Reconfiguring value consumption by enabling new forms of consumer behavior
Reconfiguring quality control through community-driven curation

***Structural impacts of platform disruption***
De-linking assets from value
Re-intermediation
Market aggregation

***The incumbents fight back: Pipelines becoming platforms***
They'll need to ask questions:

* Which processes that we curently manage in-house can be delegated to outside partners, whether suppliers or consumers?
* How can we empower outside partners to create products/services that will generate new forms of value for our existing customers?
* Are there way swe can network w/current competitors to produce valuable new services for customers?
* How can the value of the goods & services we currently provide be enhanced through new data streams, interpersonal connection, and curation tools?

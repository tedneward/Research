["28 Sprint Anti-Patterns"](https://age-of-product.com/sprint-anti-patterns/)

[The Age of Agile Must End](https://uxdesign.cc/the-age-of-agile-must-end-bc89c0f084b7): "As far as manifestos go, this is one of the more pathetic documents ever created. It lists four "Values" and twelve "Principles." They may have been well-intentioned at their inception — that intention was to treat developers as humans, not cogs in a machine — but now we’ve gone full circle. These principles have devolved into something caustic for organizations. Viewed now, they’re variations on a theme of how a scrum pod can absolve themselves of any accountability.

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. *(Yeah, we’re gonna do things however we want)*
* Welcome changing requirements, even in late development. *(We can also change our minds whenever)*
* Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted. *(Leave us alone, take what you get)*
* Working software is the primary measure of progress. *(The fact that we produced something, anything, is all that matters)*
* Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential. *(We are going to do as little as possible)*
* Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. *(Don’t tell us what to do)*

"The combination of Agile principles and Scrum practices is disastrous for startups. These are operational directives from management; designers, PM’s, and engineers are not self-organizing and choosing to work this way. It’s all in the name of an "MVP" and time to market; this is what happens. *Every. Time.*"

["Software Development Waste"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313360479_Software_Development_Waste): "The purpose of this paper is to identify and describe different kinds of waste in software development."

[Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/): Pushing to main/master ain't all as bad as it's cracked up to be. "A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called ‘trunk’ *, resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after."

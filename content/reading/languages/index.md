STATUTE eventually became Oracle Policy Modelling now Oracle Intelligent Advisor today / STATUTE made key design decisions about using limited natural language to achieve "practical isomorphism" between legislation/policy structure and the rules that form the implementation as a program. / This decision - made in a garage in Australia in 1989 by David Mead - cut programmers out of the loop, creating a form of end-user programming for those trained in law and policy. / This decision - made in a garage in Australia in 1989 by David Mead - cut programmers out of the loop, creating a form of end-user programming for those trained in law and policy. / If you feel like you're a PL guru and you've "seen it all" in how programming+logic can be delivered as a usable tool, I'd encourage you to watch Davin's demo from [the keynote](https://youtu.be/bLob9Ah1004). Conceptually it opens up a different kind of tooling for domains dominated by language and policy."

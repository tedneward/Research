Summary:

* Use the Inverse Conway: Whereby an organisation focuses on organising team structures to match the architecture they want the system to exhibit, rather than expecting teams to follow a mandated architecture design.

* Minimise Extraneous Team Cognitive Load so that teams can focus on the work that really matters.

* The four-team topologies, interaction modes (see image below) and effective software boundaries will help improve the flow of value.

# Preface

Teams are always a work in progress.

Ideally teams should be long-lived, autonomous (*not* isolated), with engaged team members.

Team interactions need to evolve over time to support the distinct phases of discovery and execution that products and technology go through during their lifetimes.

(This book) is not a universal formula for building and running software systems successfully. (This book) is meant to provide clear patterns. *(Orchestra/band analogy; these patterns are "printed music".)*

Four team types, three interaction modes

***Key Influences that Informed This Book***
First, we assume that an organization is a sociotechnical system or ecosystem that is shaped by the interaction of individuals and the teams within it; in other words, that an organization is the interaction between people and technology. In this aspect, the book fits with ideas from the fields of cybernetics, system thinking, and approaches such as the Cynefin framework for assessing domain complexity. *(From HBR 2007, ["A Leader's Framework for Decision Making"](https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making))*

Second, we assume that "the team" is something that behaves differently from a mere collection of individuals, and that the team should be nurtured and supported in its evolution and operation.

Third, we assume that Conway's Law (or a variant of it) is a strong driver of software product shape and that organizations would benefit from explicitly addressing the implications of this law.

# Part I: Teams As the Means of Delivery

Key Takeaways:

Chapter 1

* Conway's law suggests minor gains from designing software architectures and team interactions together, since they are similar forces.
* Team Topologies clarifies team purpose and responsibilities, increasing the effectiveness of their interrelationships.
* Team Topologies takes a humanistic approach to building software systems while setting up organizations for strategic adaptability.

Chapter 2

* Organizations are constrained to produce designs that reflect communication paths.
* The design of the organization constrains the "solution search space," limiting possible software designs.
* Requiring everyone to communicate with everyone else is a recipe for a mess.
* Choose software architectures that encourage team-scoped flow.
* Limiting communication paths to well-defined team interactions produces modular, decoupled systems.

Chapter 3

* The team is the most effective means of software delivery, not individuals.
* Limit the size of multi-team groupins within the organization based on Dunbar's number.
* Restrict team responsibilities to match the maximum team cognitive level.
* Establish clear boundaries of responsibility for teens.
* Change the team working environment to help teams succeed.

# Chapter 1 - The Problem with Org Charts

Team Topologies focuses on how to set up dynamic team structures and interaction modes that can help teams adapt quickly to new conditions, and achieve fast and safe software delivery.

An org chart is always out of sync with reality.
3 organizational structures in each org (Niels Pflaeging):
Formal:
The org chart.
Facilitates compliance.
Informal:
“Real of influence” between individuals.
Value creation:
How work actually gets done based on inter-personal and inter-team reputation.
Pflaeging: Key to success in knowledge work is in the interactions between the informal and value creation structures.
2 key concepts:
Empowered teams as fundamental building block:
Empowering is the way of moving from group of people to a team.
Interaction modes: build trust between teams.
Naomi Stanford five rules for designing org:
Design when there is a compelling reason.
Develop options for deciding on design.
Chose the right time for design.
Look for clues that things are out of alignment.
Stay alert to the future.
Team Topologies == 4 fundamental team types + 3 core interactions + Conway’s law + Team Cognitive Load + Sensing Organisation + evolution.
Teams are indivisible elements of SW delivery.
Dan Pink’s three elements of intrinsic motivation:
Autonomy.
Mastery.
Purpose.
Teams have finite cognitive capacity:
If exceeded, team struggles to achieve mastery.
Delays, quality issues, decrease in motivation.
Conway’s law.
SW consultancy:
No autonomy: constant juggling of requests from customers.
No mastery: “jack of all trades, master of none”.
No purpose: too many domains of responsibility.
Obstacles to flow:
Disengaged teams.
Pushing against Conway’s law.
SW too big for team.
Confusing org design.
Team pulled in many directions.
Painful re-org every few years.
Flow is blocked.
Too many surprised.

Summary:

* Use the Inverse Conway: Whereby an organisation focuses on organising team structures to match the architecture they want the system to exhibit, rather than expecting teams to follow a mandated architecture design.

* Minimise Extraneous Team Cognitive Load so that teams can focus on the work that really matters.

* The four-team topologies, interaction modes (see image below) and effective software boundaries will help improve the flow of value.

# Preface

Teams are always a work in progress.

Ideally teams should be long-lived, autonomous (*not* isolated), with engaged team members.

Team interactions need to evolve over time to support the distinct phases of discovery and execution that products and technology go through during their lifetimes.

(This book) is not a universal formula for building and running software systems successfully. (This book) is meant to provide clear patterns. *(Orchestra/band analogy; these patterns are "printed music".)*

Four team types, three interaction modes

***Key Influences that Informed This Book***
First, we assume that an organization is a sociotechnical system or ecosystem that is shaped by the interaction of individuals and the teams within it; in other words, that an organization is the interaction between people and technology. In this aspect, the book fits with ideas from the fields of cybernetics, system thinking, and approaches such as the Cynefin framework for assessing domain complexity. *(From HBR 2007, ["A Leader's Framework for Decision Making"](https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making))*

Second, we assume that "the team" is something that behaves differently from a mere collection of individuals, and that the team should be nurtured and supported in its evolution and operation.

Third, we assume that Conway's Law (or a variant of it) is a strong driver of software product shape and that organizations would benefit from explicitly addressing the implications of this law.

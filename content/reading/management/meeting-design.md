# Introduction
**Meetings are a Design Problem.** Meetings should add value to your life by providing a sense of progress--problems being defined, decisions getting made, priorities being prioritized, and solutions being built upon the benefit of multiple perspectives.

Two kinds of people: makers (software, documents, code, or other products and outcomes) and managers (responsibility of overseeing other people who make the things you used to make). *(NOTE: Presumption is that makers don't own meetings, managers do. Not sure that holds.)*

# Part 1: The Theory and Practice of Meeting Design
***Frame, build, optimize, facilitate, and measure meetings that do a job.***

Meetings can create great outcomes if you want them to. They come from being intentional with the time you spend together; meeting design is the practice of expressing that intention.

## Chapter 1: How to Design a Meeting
***Think like a designer about the gatherings already taking place.***

**What is a Well-Designed Meeting?**: Well-designed things make our lives simpler or more pleasing. *Design* is an intangible currency that separates things that matter from junk. 

Meetings are usually not designed. Lack of a clearly defined agenda is a symptom of the problem, but designing a meeting means more than just having an agenda--that meetings aren't considered in the same way that designers consider problems they are trying to solve. Thinking like a designer means taking an iterative, cyclical approach, mixing in research and testing of concepts.

This design process approach:
1. Clearly define the problem that a design should solve through observation and good old-fashioned research.
2. Create and consider multiple options, as opposed to sticking to a single solution.
3. Selet the option assumed to be the best and begin an interative effort to refine it from a minimum viable concept. This contrasts with spending excessive time visualizing he finished product in every detail.
4. Execute/"ship" at an agreed-upon fidelity so that you have an opportunity to see how the design fares in the real world with real people. After that, goto step 1 as needed.

### Apply Design Thinking to Existing Meetings
Your calendar is littered with recurring team meetings (standing meetings, check-ins, *(NOTE: standups?)* ); for each one of these always have two questions in the back of your mind:

* Why did you establish this meeting?
* Has that job been done?

If you can't answer the first, or the second answer is "yes", delete/decline the meeting. Continuing to expect a productive outcome out of the same get-together when the goals have already been achieved (or new goals haven't been clearly articulated) is a special kind of insanity. To combat that insanity:

1. Identify the problem the meeting is intended to solve. Understand that problem sufficiently with research or a clear understanding of constraints.
2. Revisit and experiment with format, including length of time and method of facilitation. Consider skipping a few meetings, just to see what happens.
3. Make changes to the meeting semi-permanent after observing successes. Eliminate changes that don't produce successes.
4. Walk away from meetings that no longer do the job intended.

### Identify the problem
People often throw meetings at problems w/o sufficiently examining the problem itself. When the problem feels under-/un-defined, identify and agree on the problem the meeting is intended to solve, then diagnose.

Working from a primary problem, you can identify secondary problems.

A meeting is a synchronous approach to communication.

### Consider Multiple Formats
A conversation is only one of several ways to structure time--collaboratively visualizing the process (sticky notes on a wall, for example). Exclusively relying on conversation and human memory is a single pattern for executing a meeting--there are other patterns.

### Make Small Changes and Assess Improvements
With iterative changes over time, a regularly scheduled standing meeting can be tweaked to balance contributions and use structured collaboration to reclaim precious time.

One option to introduce is a time limit for individual speakers. Writing before speaking with a target length (such as a single sentence) also encourages people to consider what they say before they say it.

### Know When the Job is Done
Walking away from something that has done its job feels great. Agreement about how long a meeting is going to be in place can be reached by following the design thinking process to its natural conclusion.

### A Better Definition of "Meeting"
Habits are the result of behaviors becoming separated from an awareness of the intentions behind those behaviors. When habits form as parts of the process of working together, such as standing meetings, those meetings start to be labeled with descriptions, rather than ascribed with purpose. When you apply design process to meetings, you reconnect getting together with having a reason to do it.

A meeting is something that enables us to achieve an outcome that we can't otherwise achieve without it, measured in an agreed-upon fashion. If you've got the money for gas and maintenance, a car is the freedom to relocate yourself; a meeting is a mechanism for creating meaningful change in your work.

## Chapter 2: The Design Constraint of All Meetings
***Design conversations to work effectrively within limits posed by the human brain.***

### Better Meetings Make Better Memories
There is one design constraint that all huans bring: their capacity to remember the discussion.

## Chapter 3: Build Agendas Out of Ideas, People, and Time
***How much content can be covered? How many people can you invite? How much time will this agenda take?***

## Chapter 4: Manage Conflict with Facilitation
***Build from a classic definition of facilitation that works in any organization, and find productive conflict that moves things forward.***

## Chapter 5: Facilitation Strategy and Style
***Sometimes, great facilitation can be as simple as asking the right question. But other times, a facilitator may need to adapt.***

## Chapter 6: Better Mettings Lead to Better Organizations
***A meeting is a window into a group's culture. Assess that culture, build a new one, and introduce changes through better get-togethers.***

# Part 2: Designed Meetings
***A collection of meetings design to produce outcomes and decisions.***

## Chapter 7: Get Started with Beginning Meetings
***Start a project or process with gatherings that reduce ambiguity and create direction.***

## Chapter 8: Chart the Course Using Middle Meetings
***Stuck in the middle of a project? Need to course correct? Use a well-designed conversation to map the terrain.***

## Chapter 9: Find Closure with End Meetings
***Wrap up your work with meetings that lead to continued growth and evolution.***

*(by Daniel Goleman, from "HBR's 10 Must Reads: The Essentials")*

Emotional intelligence is a group of five skills that enable the best leaders to maximize their own and their followers' performance:

* **Self-awareness.** Knowing one's strengths, weaknesses, drives, values, and impact onothers.

    * Self-confidence
    * Realistic self-assessment
    * Self-deprecating sense of humor
    * Thirst for constructive criticism

* **Self-regulation.** Controlling or redirecting disruptive impulses and moods. People who are in control of their feelings and impulses are able to create an environment of trust and fairness, which has a trickle-down effect. Secondly, people who have mastered their emotions are able to roll with the changes/punches and don't panic, or even lead the way.

    * Trustworthiness
    * Propensity for reflection and thoughtfulness
    * Integrity
    * Comfort with ambiguity and change
    * An ability to say "no" to impulsive urges

* **Motivation.** (Intrinsic motivation) Relishing achievement for its own sake.

    * A passion for the work itself and for new challenges
    * Forever raising the performance bar
    * Like to keep score
    * Unflagging energy to improve
    * Optimism in the face of failure
    * Commitment to the organization

* **Empathy.** Understanding other peoples' emotional makeup. Important due to the increasing use of teams; the rapid pace of globalization; and the growing need to retain talent.

    * Expertise in attracting and retaining talent
    * Ability to develop others
    * Sensitivity to cross-cultural differences

* **Social skill.** "Friendliness with a purpose." Building rapport with others to move them in desired directions. Socially skilled people build bonds widely because they know that in fluid times, they may need help someday from people they are just getting to know today.

    * Tend to have a wide circle of acquaintances
    * Knack for finding common ground with people of all kinds--for building rapport
    * Effectiveness is leading change
    * Persuasiveness
    * Extensive networking
    * Expertise in building and leading teams

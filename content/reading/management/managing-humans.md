# Part I: The Management Quiver
### Don't Be a Prick
"My definition of a manager is someone with whom you can make a connection no matter where you sit in the org chart. ... It's your ability to construct an insightful opinion about a person in seconds that will help make you a phenomenal manager. ... Every single person with whom you work has a vastly different set of needs. ... It is your full-time job to listen to these people and mentally document how they are built."

### Managers Are Not Evil
*Your manager's job is not your job.* Your manager is your face to the rest of the organization; give him something to say. ... Each manager, good or bad, is going to have a glaring deficiency; does he recognize he has a blind spot? A manager's job is to transform his glaring deficiency into a strength by finding the best person to fill it and trust him to do the job. ... Schedule 1:1s with direct reports, keep them on the same day and time, and never cancel them. You will always learn something in your 1:1. ... Pure delegators are slowly becoming irrelevant to their organizations. Real work is visible action managers take to support their particular vision for their organization. ... Politically active managers are informed managers. They know when change is afoot and they know what action to take to best represent their org in that change. ... Question #1: Where did I come from? (Being able to relate to those you manage comes from intimately understanding their job.) Question #2: Where am I going? (A plan for your manager's next big move is his incentive.)

### The Rands Test

* Do you have a 1:1?
* Do you have a team meeting?
* Do you have status reports? [Rands gives this a -1: "email-based status reports come down to control, a lack of imagination, and a lack of trust in the organization. I'm not convinced.]
* Can you say no to your boss?
* Can you explain the strategy of the company to a stranger?
* Can you explain the current state of business?
* Does the person in charge regularly stand up in front of everyone and say what they're thinking? Are you buying it?
* Do you know what you want to do next? Does your boss?
* Do you have time to be strategic?
* Are you actively killing the Grapevine? [Kill gossip.]
		
### How to Run a Meeting

* Alignment meetings: tactical communication exchanges that rarely dive into the strategic.
* Creation meetings: diving into solving a hard problem
* Meetings have two critical components: an agenda, and a referee. Referee's job is to shape the meeting to meet the requirements of the agenda and the expectations of the participants. A good referee not only makes sure the majority of the attendees believe progress is being made, but they're aware of anyone who doesn't believe that progress is being made at any given moment. And they're looking for people being checked out. If their attention is elsewhere, they aren't listening. How do we keep everyone engaged? Pull them back (steer the conversation toward them); reset the meeting with silence (when all eyes are on you, count backwards from 10); change the scenery. Referee needs to own the meeting (actively demonstrate control of the meeting), improvise (solution to whatever the hard problem might be is going to show up via one of two things: random brilliance or grindingly hard work), knows when the meeting is nowhere the stated agenda but is making progress, knows when participant who appears to be rambling and wasting everyone's time is onto something that might lead to random brilliance so let them go, knows the glaring danger signs for a meeting that is doomed, and has the courage to stop this meeting five minutes into the scheduled hour because there is no discernible way to make progress.

### The Twinge
There is no way you can do it all; you need to trust and you need to delegate. You must also understand the art of evaluating a Spartan set of data, extracting the truth, and trusting your Twinges. Your day is full of stories; stories are the chosen version of reality on the part of the storyteller. Their agenda dictates what they are choosing to tell you. A Twinge is your experience speaking to you in an unexpected and possibly unstructured way.
	
### The Update, the Vent, and the Disaster
Your job in a 1:1 is to give the smallest voice a chance to be heard; start with a question: "How are you?" Hold a 1:1 the same time each week. Always do it. Give it 30 minutes at least. "How are you" leads to one of three buckets:

* **The Update** *(all clear!)*: 1:1s should not be status updates--if no meaty conversation appears in 15 minutes, have three prepared talking points, do a mini-performance review, or my current disaster.
  
* **The Vent** *(something's up...)*: your job is to listen for as long as it takes. Be aware of when it becomes a rant. Vents are motivated by emotion. Vents can spiral into a Disaster.

* **The Disaster** *(oh dear...)*: you're under attack. The absolute worst response is any semblance of emotion. The person you're talking to isn't him/herself. Shut up (really); defuse by contributing nothing. Because whatever this is, it's not about the issue anymore--it's about the emotional baggage attached to the issue. A Disaster is the end result of poor management--when your employee believes that totally losing their shit is a productive strategy, it's because they believe it's the only option left for making anything change. Your reward for a culture of healthy 1:1s is a distinct lack of drama.
	
### The Monday Freakout
If somebody is going to freak out, it's going to be on a Monday. Don't participate in the freakout; don't jump on the bandwagon; simply listen and maintain eye contact. Give the freak the benefit of the doubt. Hammer the freak with questions; the key with a question offense is to move your freak from the emotional state into the rational one. Get the freaks to solve their own problems. You still have a problem; freakouts are a normal event in passionate engineering teams, but it's still a management failure.
	
### Lost in Translation
[Understanding motivation.] When communications are down, listen hard, repeat everything, and assume nothing.
	
### Agenda Detection
Agenda detection is the ability to discern (a) typical meeting roles and how meeting participants assume them; (b) explanation of what these distinct meeting roles want out of a meeting; (c) how to use this understanding to get the hell out of the meeting as quickly as possible.

* Identify the type of meeting: 

    * Informational; two kinds of roles: talkers and listeners.

    * Conflict Resolution; some kind of problem needs to be solved.

* Classify the participants

    * Players: they want something out of the meeting

    * Pawns: are either silent or instruments of running the meeting

* Identify the Players

    * Identify the Pros and Cons (subclasses of Players); Pros are "winning" and aren't incented to negotiate; Cons are the ones being screwed and are usually easy to pick out because they're expressing some degree of pissed-off-ness.

    * Figure out the Issue. What do the Cons want?

    * Give the Cons what they want. They want a plan, some assurance that will somewhat address whatever the issue is. Cons will not let you out of that meeting until there is the perception of forward progress.

    * Figure out the Issue. If it's 30 minutes in and you still can't figure out what the issue is, it's time to go: too many issues. Someone who cares more than you needs to distill this one down so Pros and Cons can argue about one thing.

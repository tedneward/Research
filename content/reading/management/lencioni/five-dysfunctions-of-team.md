# An Overview of the Model
First, genuine teamwork in most organizations remains as elusive as it has ever been. Second, organizations fail to achieve teamwork because they unknowingly fall prey to five dysfunctions of a team. These dysfunctions can be mistakenly interpreted as five distinct issues that can be addressed in isolation with the others. But in reality they form an interrelated model, making susceptibility to even one of them potentially lethal for the success of a team. A cursory overview of each dysfunction, and the model they comprise, should make this clearer.

1. **Absence of trust** among the team members.
2. **Fear of conflict** leading to an incapability to engage in unfiltered and passionate debate of ideas.
3. **Lack of commitment** to decisions.
4. **Avoidance of accountability**. Without committing to a clear plan of action, even the most focused and driven people often hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviors that seem counterproductive to the good of the team.
5. **Inattention to results** occurs when team members put their individual needs (such as ego, career development, or recognition) or even the needs of their divisions above the collective goals of the team.

Another way to understand this model is to take the opposite approach--a positive one--and imagine how members of truly cohesive teams behave:

1. **They trust one another.**
2. **They engage in unfiltered conflict around ideas.**
3. **They commit to decisions and plans of action.**
4. **They hold one another accountable for delivering against those plans.**
5. **They focus on the achievement of collective results.**

In theory, it is simple, in practice, it is extremely difficult because it requires levels of discipline and persistence that few teams can muster.

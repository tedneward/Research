"The best engineering interview question I've ever gotten" [Part 1](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2022/01/06/memcached-interview/) [Part 2](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2022/01/07/memcached-interview-solution/): The challenge: Modifying `memcached` -- Via its `incr` and `decr` commands, memcached provides a built-in way to atomically add `k` to a number. But it doesnâ€™t provide other arithmetic operations; in particular, there is no "atomic multiply by `k`" operation. Your programming challenge: **Add a `mult` command to memcached.**

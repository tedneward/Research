## Introduction
*Performance Management for a New Age of Work*

Performance management is an interconnected set of tools used to measure and improve the effectiveness of people in the workplace. High-perfoming teams use performance management to achieve three goals: to develop individuals' skills and capabilities, to reward all employees equitably, and to drive overall organizational performance.

### The Evolution of Performance Management
Traditional process began as a system for assessing and maximizing the productivity of industrial workers; the cycle generally began w./annual goals for each employee and at the end of the year, people were formally appraised based on how successfully they achieved those objectives. Assessment was based on production-based metrics.

These don't align with roles that prize creativity and innovation and staffed by knowledge workers and difficult-to-measure-results teams. While the industrial model aimed to reduce variation (in manufacturing errors, for example), many organizations today aspire to innovate by *increasing* variation. 

Metrics to gauge performance have become more complex and harder to see as causation (as opposed to correlation).

Many orgs awnt nimble, flexible instruments that can truly increase and accurately measure performance; some are shifting away from cyclical calendar-based approaches toward those based on more communication throughout the year. Some are reappraising the approach--Deloitte created a new approach that removed traditional elements (360-degree feedback, cascading objectives, and 1/yr reviews) and instead focused on "performance snapshots" in which an employee's immediate manager answers four future-focused questions about an employee--essentially asking what they'd *do* with the employee rather than what they think of the individual.

### Why Performance Management (Still) Matters
Because

* Shareholders and investors observe better results when people are working toward key goals.
* Supervisors are more successful when their reports focuson the right tasks and projects--and do them well.
* Employees appreciate focused goals, opportunities for career development, and recognition for outstanding performance.

It's rare than an org (or individual) can make real progress without setting and working toward goals. Few companies can remain competitive or retain their best people without offering opportunities to grow.

# Section One: Goal Setting
*We'll explore employee goal setting: the characteristics of effective goals, how individual and organizational goals align, and how to develop metrics to measure people's progress toward their objectives. We'll also discuss creating specific palns for enabling direct reports to meet those targets to ensure that you'll be satisfied with progress. But because established goals may no longer remain static over the course of a year, we'll also explain how to assess whether set goals are still valid--and how to make changes as necessary.*

## Chapter 1: The Characteristics of Effective Goals
*Make them clear and specific, achievable but challenging.*

Setting clear goals is the starting point of managing performance. Goals define the results that your people should aim to achieve in a given period of time. Agreeing on specific targets is only part of the goal-setting process, however. You must also define how your employee's progress toward these objectives will be evaluated and how to measure results and gauge behavioral expectations. Defining the information at the outset will make assessing performance easier for you later, and your employees will have a clear understanding of how to proceed throughout the year.

### Attributes of Well-Defined Goals

Most managers know SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Bound), but this isn't enough to make the employee valuable. Consider different criteria; effective goals must be:

* **Aligned with organizational strategy and beneficial to the company.** They focus your people's time, energy, and resources on the work that matters most.
* **Specific and measurable.** Spelling out the details ensures both of you will know when they have reached their goal. (Definition of "done")
* **Framed in time, with clear deadlines.** Including a target date for reaching a goal increases the likelihood that your employee will meet it. (Forcing functions)
* **Achievable but challenging.** Stretch goals that require individuals to reach can be energizing. (70% chance of success)
* **Future focused.** They should be geared toward improving current performance and spurring future growth.
* **Tailored to the individual.** When people are involved in setting objectives, they feel ownership and will be naturally more committed.
* **Documented but not forgotten.** Keep them front-of-mind and regularly assess. (Weekly 1:1s, quarterly reviews, whatever)

### Sources of Goals
Each of your directs should have a set of goals that is based on their role, skill level, and development aims. Do this by drawing from a variety of sources directly related to your employee's needs:

* **Organization, division, or department plans or strategies.**
* **Goals from previous review periods or those that are linked to critical job responsibilities.** Some objectives will be evergreen, others will evolve. Salespeople will always have the goal of increasing sales, but specific numerical targets will change.
* **Comments from previous perf reviews and feedback discussions.** It can be helpful to link one period's goals with those of the next, especially when they are tied to an employee's ongoing growth or improvement.

You may be tempted to draw goals from a person's job description, but JDs tend to be more about the content of the role than about the aims that managers and employes agree to pursue. As you think about potential goals, dig deeper than a simple job description; aim toward descriptive, measurable targets in your goal setting.

### The Tricky Balance of Challenge

How to make desired outcomes achievable but challenging. Stretch goals are objectives that require extra effort to reach. They're an important element of a high-performing culture and of employee development. People respond positively to a challenge. Aiming too low can lead to mediocrity.

Because they require significant effort, there's no guarantee these objectives will be achieved. When they're too valuable, stretch goals can backfire (employees discount outcomes, wind up frustrated, or act immorally/unethically). You want people to stretch, not to break. Keep in mind, too, what's impossible for one employee is an exciting test for another.


## Chapter 2: Define Employee Goals--and Decide How They're Measured
*Fit the needs of the individual and the organization.*

Each individual should have unique, personalized expectations of their own. Logically, goal-setting should be a top-down process that starts with strategy and cascades down, but the traditional "cascading goal" model has its downsides:

* No one is able to set their goals until their supervisor's goals have been established (all the way up), and employees feel like mere cogs in a wheel.
* Can directly/indirectly signal your reports that they are truly subordinate and not in control of their own goals.
* Imposed objectives are unlikely to motivate people as much as goals they had some say in developing.
* Inflexible, top-down goals can also fail to account for/take advantage of the unique interests, skills, and potential contributions of individuals.

Consider a different approach: Let your direct reports take the lead in setting their goals. Develops ownership, commitment, and accountability. "Accountability is not simply taking the blame when something goes wrong.... Accountability is about delivering on a commitment. It's responsibility to an outcome, not just a set of tasks. It's taking initiative with thoughtful, strategic follow-through."

### Set Up a Performance-Planning Session
Keep it separate from the review meeting--better focus and less emotional (and other) distraction.

While your employee may be setting goals for the year in this meeting, it's possible that those targets will need to be adjusted before the review period ends--the goals you set may not be relevant for an entire year (or even quarter). Some companies have replaced annual objectives with short-term ones. (The Gap uses quarterly targets; at GE, shorter-term "priorities" have taken the place of annual goals.) A person's goals may need to be adjusted/adapted during the year.

> Before you and your employee get together at the performance planning meeting, ask them to draft a list of goals for the two of you to review together. Give them some pointers about what makes for an effective goal, and review some promising sources for coming up with possibilities. Employees at every level should be able to articulate how their work feeds into the big-picture organizational strategy in addition to fitting with their individual skills, strengths, and ambitions.

### Define Goals
Assess the suggested goals: How do they fit into the larger picture? Can you see clear links between their expected contributions and the results they need to achieve as members of your team? Are the objectives realistic and challenging? Do they cover all the elements of the SMART rubric and meet the characteristics of well-defined goals? Make sure both organizational needs and the employee's professional aspirations are accounted for.

***Aligning goals with those of the organization***
Each unit, team, and individual should have goals that directly support the organization's larger strategic objectives. Your employee may already understand your team and organization's strategic efforts, but don't assume they do. Understanding *why* a goal is important, on both an individual and an organizational level.

Do each of the proposed goals line up with these big-picture efforts? Do they fit within a larger organizational/team strategy? By defining together how these goals can contribute to a larger organizational purpose, their sense of ownership and engagement can grow.

If it doesn't match a team/org aim, assess whether it's the right fit. Revise or remove.

Also discuss whether there are goals missing that would be important to add from the org perspective.

***Aligning personal interests with professional goals***
Understanding your directs at a personal level will help you both in the goal-setting process and every other facet of performance management. How can the unit goals be crafted to inspire the highest level of enthusiasm from each person? What are your employees' career ambitions? Are their professional goals compatible with those the unit/organization must pursue? Activities that contribute to organizational success can also spur individual employee development--and people can find the intersection of professional goals and personal interests highly motivating.

Ask your team members if they would be comfortable telling you about their personal interest during your performance-planning meeting if their list doesn't seem to include them. Even employees who share identical titles and roles can adjust certain goals or take on specific tasks that best suit their interests, tap into their strengths, and reflect their personal traits.

### Set a Reasonable Number of Goals
Instead of burying someone in a flurry of goals, prioritize: Focus on two to four challenging, specific, signficant goals.

People can also be overwhelmed by complex and large goals--it can be helpful to break a goal into smaller pieces, or to set shorter-term aims. Setting monthly or quarterly goals, rather than annual ones, can narrow the focus enough to make the target achievable while still having a big impact.

### Establish Ways to Measure Success
Once you/your employee agree on a set of meaningful goals, determine how you plan to assess progress toward each one. List anticipated outcomes and measures for each item. Keep the following pitfalls in mind as you define how objectives will be evaluated:

* **Missing metrics.** Some goals may not be obviously connected to clear performance metrics.
* **Choosing the wrong metrics.** Not all that can be measured is equally important or worth targeting.
* **Overemphasizing metrics.** Performance is a combination of two factors: behaviors and results. If results are the "what" of performance, behaviors are the "how". Noting the behavior and work behind a specific goal is just as important as the metric itself, even if it's not easily quantifiable.

***When goals aren't easily quantified***
Some goals are more qualitative and therefore harder to measure. In such cases, you should still be able to pinpoint tangible, measurable targets within them. If you're struggling to find a suitable unit of measure, set a more specific, metric-friendly goal targeting something that can be measured.

Determine in advance how you plan to measure progress for each goal, whether it's a numerical or time-based target. Be specific: If you were evaluating an individual who wanted to improve their public speaking, you might want to agree on how you define "public presentations".

Don't make the mistake of dismissing what you can't quantify. When it comes time to assess an employee's performance, you'll want to look beyond simply measured aspects.

### Establish Expectations, Not Just Goals
When you discuss objectives with your employees, you should also talk about what you expect of them in terms of behavior. Your direct may understand what they must achieve, but if they do so in a way that's detrimental to your team or the organization, their contributions won't matter. Talk through your expectations for citizenship behaviors (stepping in to help colleagues in need, serving as a resource for others, cooperating and demonstrating flexibility, and training new hires) as well as basic competencies like behaving professionally. Understanding behavioral expectations is important to creating a collaborative and productive work environment--and you should make it clear to your employees that you value their contributions and cooperation on this front as much as you do their work results.



## Chapter 3: Collaborate with Your Employee to Create a Plan for Moving Forward
*Outline steps to accomplish objectives and adjust as necessary.*



# Section Two: Ongoing Performance Management
*We'll discuss the process of observing, documenting, and improving performance throughout the year. You'll learn how to identify performance gaps and assess why they occur, effectively coach and deliver feedback, recognize good work, and motivate people to do their best.*

# Section Three: 
*We'll address employee career development: how to ensure that your people are growing professionally. Regardless of how your organization's formal performance management process is run, employee development efforts are becoming a focus of every manager who wants to lead an engaged, high-performing team and drive business. You'll learn how to discover your employees' unique needs and ambitions, identify the tactics available to your direct reports to build their skills, determine a direction for growth, and create individualized development plans to propel people forward--even those who are struggling.*

# Section Four: 
*We'll delve into the details of formal performance reviews. This section first presents current arguments for and against formal appraisals--and for those who do conduct them, offers a detailed process for success. We'll help you navigate the practice of assessing a direct report's progress toward previously established goals and show you how to put your appraisal in writing, including how to use ratings most effectively. We'll cover how to conduct the review session, from detailing performance to preparing for the review period ahead.*

# Section Five:
*We'll explore topics that managers struggle with in performance management. We'll begin by explaining how to support and nurture your B players: those who are neither amibitious standouts nor strugglers. We'll also discuss howto avoid burnout on your team--a problem that tends to affect the most valuable, hardest-working employees. Finally, you'll learn how to manage the performance of remote employees you rarely (or never) see in person.*

* ["A Simple Framework for Software Engineering Management"](https://medium.com/swlh/a-simple-framework-for-software-engineering-management-f70b216540f2): Responsibilities (people management, delivery leadership, technical system ownership) in a 2-axis grid with priorities (issues, things that are OK, ideas/aspirations). "To sum up, we can look at software engineering management as a combination of three areas of responsibilities: people management, delivery leadership, and technical system ownership. Paying attention to all three responsibilities is important. However the amount of attention each responsibility should get depends on the team, the organisation, the product, and other factors. It also changes over time. Within each responsibility area we can identify issues, things that are okay, as well as ideas and aspirations. Things that are already okay only need to be acknowledged. Issues need to be prioritised and promptly resolved. Ideas and aspirations should be evaluated and, if deemed relevant, executed or put on the roadmap."

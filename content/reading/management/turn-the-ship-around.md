summary="A true story of turning followers into leaders." Management principles from a submarine captain.
~~~~~~
*(by L. David Marquet)*

"The core of the leader-leader model is giving employees *control* over what they work on and how they work. It means letting them make meaningful decisions. The two enabling pillars are *competence* and *clarity*."

***Control***

* Find the genetic code for control and rewrite it
* Act your way to new thinking
* Short, early conversations make efficient work
* Use "I intend to..." to turn passive followers into active leaders
* Resist the urge to provide solutions
* Eliminate top-down monitoring systems
* Think out loud (both superiors and subordinates)
* Embrace the inspectors

***Competence***

* Take deliberate action
* We learn (everywhere, all the time)
* Don't brief, certify
* Continually and consistently repeat the message
* Specify goals, not methods

***Clarity***

* Achieve excellence, don't just avoid errors
* Build trust and take care of your people
* Use your legacy for inspiration
* Use guiding principles for decision criteria
* Use immediate recognition to reinforce desired behaviors
* Begin with the end in mind
* Encourage a questioning attitude over blind obedience

# Part I **Starting Over**

History and prelude to taking command of the *Sante Fe*.

1. **Pain**: Author's history aboard the *Will Rogers*; wanted to install leader-leader but met with failure, gave up; did some research. Found three contradictions:
    - "though I liked the idea of empowerment, I didn't understand why it was needed. ... humans are born in a state of action and natural empowerment. ... Additionally, it seemed inherently contradictory to have an empowerment program whereby I would empower my subordinates and my boss would empower me--I felt my power came from within, and attempts to empower me felt like manipulation."
    - "the way I was told to manage others was not the way I wanted to be managed. I felt I was at my best when given specific goals but broad latitude in how to accomplish them."
    - "I was disturbed by the close coupling of the technical competence of the leader with the performance of the organization. ... a good ship could become a bad ship overnight when a new CO came aboard."
    "Essentially, what I had been trying to achieve on *Will Rogers* was to ran an empowerment program within a leader-follower structure." *"One of the things that limits our learning is our belief that we already know something."*

    Questions to consider:

    * Why do we need empowerment? Do you need someone else to empower you?
    * How reliant is your organization on the decision making of one person, or a small group of people?
    * What kind of leadership model does your business or organization use?
    * When you think of movie images that depict leadership, who/what comes to mind? What assumptions are embedded in those images? How do these images influence how you think about yourself as a leader? To what extent do these images limit your growth as a leader?

2. **Business as Usual**: Author is anticipating taking command of the *Olympia*. Took PCO (prospective commanding officer) training; "During one torpedo approach, I devised an elaborate ruse that would flush out the opposing sub and make it a sitting duck for our attack. I predicted to the officers in the control room--in this case, other PCOs--what would happen. The situation developed exactly as I'd forseen, and we were able to get a hit on a quiet and tenacious enemy. In the middle of the attack, however, I'd had to reach over and do the job of one of the PCOs because he had gotten confused. I thought I was brilliant, but Captain Kenny took me aside and upbraided me. ***It didn't matter how smart my plan was if the team couldn't execute it!***" 
    When author tried to get on board the *Olympia* to observe, he was refused: "captains are graded on how well their ships perform up to the day they depart; not a day longer. After that it becomes someone else's problem. ... On every submarine and ship, hundreds of captains were making thousands of decisions to optimize the performance of their commands for their tour and their tour alone. If they did anything for the long run it was because of an enlightened sense of duty, not because there was anything in the system that rewarded them for it. We didn't associate an officer's leadership effectiveness with how well his unit performed after he left. We didn't associate an officer's leadership effectiveness with how often his people got promoted two, three, or four years hence. All that mattered was performance in the moment."

    Questions to consider:

    * In your org, are people rewarded for what happens after they transfer? Are they rewarded for the success of their people? Do they want to be "missed" after they leave?
    * When an org does worse immediately after the departure of a leader, what does this say about that person's leadership? How does the org view this situation?
    * How does the perspective of time horizon affect our leadership actions?
    * What can we do to incentivize long-term thinking?

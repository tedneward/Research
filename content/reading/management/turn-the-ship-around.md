summary="A true story of turning followers into leaders." Management principles from a submarine captain.
~~~~~~
*(by L. David Marquet)* [PDF](../TurntheShipAround.PDF)

"The core of the leader-leader model is giving employees *control* over what they work on and how they work. It means letting them make meaningful decisions. The two enabling pillars are *competence* and *clarity*."

***Control***

* Find the genetic code for control and rewrite it
* Act your way to new thinking
* Short, early conversations make efficient work
* Use "I intend to..." to turn passive followers into active leaders
* Resist the urge to provide solutions
* Eliminate top-down monitoring systems
* Think out loud (both superiors and subordinates)
* Embrace the inspectors

***Competence***

* Take deliberate action
* We learn (everywhere, all the time)
* Don't brief, certify
* Continually and consistently repeat the message
* Specify goals, not methods

***Clarity***

* Achieve excellence, don't just avoid errors
* Build trust and take care of your people
* Use your legacy for inspiration
* Use guiding principles for decision criteria
* Use immediate recognition to reinforce desired behaviors
* Begin with the end in mind
* Encourage a questioning attitude over blind obedience

# Part I **Starting Over**

History and prelude to taking command of the *Sante Fe*.

1. **Pain**: Author's history aboard the *Will Rogers*.
    Wanted to install leader-leader but met with failure, gave up; did some research. Found three contradictions:

    - "though I liked the idea of empowerment, I didn't understand why it was needed. ... humans are born in a state of action and natural empowerment. ... Additionally, it seemed inherently contradictory to have an empowerment program whereby I would empower my subordinates and my boss would empower me--I felt my power came from within, and attempts to empower me felt like manipulation."
    - "the way I was told to manage others was not the way I wanted to be managed. I felt I was at my best when given specific goals but broad latitude in how to accomplish them."
    - "I was disturbed by the close coupling of the technical competence of the leader with the performance of the organization. ... a good ship could become a bad ship overnight when a new CO came aboard."
    
    "Essentially, what I had been trying to achieve on *Will Rogers* was to ran an empowerment program within a leader-follower structure." *"One of the things that limits our learning is our belief that we already know something."*

    Questions to consider:

    * Why do we need empowerment? Do you need someone else to empower you?
    * How reliant is your organization on the decision making of one person, or a small group of people?
    * What kind of leadership model does your business or organization use?
    * When you think of movie images that depict leadership, who/what comes to mind? What assumptions are embedded in those images? How do these images influence how you think about yourself as a leader? To what extent do these images limit your growth as a leader?

2. **Business as Usual**: Author is anticipating taking command of the *Olympia*.
    Took PCO (prospective commanding officer) training; "During one torpedo approach, I devised an elaborate ruse that would flush out the opposing sub and make it a sitting duck for our attack. I predicted to the officers in the control room--in this case, other PCOs--what would happen. The situation developed exactly as I'd forseen, and we were able to get a hit on a quiet and tenacious enemy. In the middle of the attack, however, I'd had to reach over and do the job of one of the PCOs because he had gotten confused. I thought I was brilliant, but Captain Kenny took me aside and upbraided me. ***It didn't matter how smart my plan was if the team couldn't execute it!***" 

    When author tried to get on board the *Olympia* to observe, he was refused: "captains are graded on how well their ships perform up to the day they depart; not a day longer. After that it becomes someone else's problem. ... On every submarine and ship, hundreds of captains were making thousands of decisions to optimize the performance of their commands for their tour and their tour alone. If they did anything for the long run it was because of an enlightened sense of duty, not because there was anything in the system that rewarded them for it. We didn't associate an officer's leadership effectiveness with how well his unit performed after he left. We didn't associate an officer's leadership effectiveness with how often his people got promoted two, three, or four years hence. All that mattered was performance in the moment."

    Questions to consider:

    * In your org, are people rewarded for what happens after they transfer? Are they rewarded for the success of their people? Do they want to be "missed" after they leave?
    * When an org does worse immediately after the departure of a leader, what does this say about that person's leadership? How does the org view this situation?
    * How does the perspective of time horizon affect our leadership actions?
    * What can we do to incentivize long-term thinking?

3. **Change of Course**: Author has been abruptly reassigned to command *Santa Fe*; meets with boss (Commodore, Squadron Seven), who had "argued forcefully for me to be assigned the job of turning *Santa Fe* around". Was offered opportunity to let a few people go, but "'I don't think that will help the crew. I think a better focus would be on working with what you've got.'" ("In the end, I fired no one.") "This was important because it sent the message to each crew member that he wasn't screwed up, the leadership was. My challenge would be to use the same people and support team and by changing the way they interacted and behaved, increase the effectiveness."

    "Upon reflection, Commodore Kenny was providing great leadership. He presented me with a specific goal--have *Santa Fe* ready for deployment in every way--but did not tell me how to do it. The other thing he was telling me was that the people and resources available to the ship would be the same as they were before and the same as they were to any other submarine. Consequently, the only thing we could change was how we acted and interacted. This would be my focus."

    Questions to consider:

    * What are you willing to personally risk? (Sometimes taking a step for the better requires caring/not caring: Caring deeply about the people and mission, but not caring about the bureaucratic consequences to your personal career.)
    * What must leaders overcome mentally and emotionally to give up control yet retain full responsibility?
    * What's the hardest thing you experience in letting go of micromanaging, top-down leadership, or the cult of personality?
    * How can you get your project teams interacting differently but still use the same resources?
    * What can you as a subordinate do to get your boss to let you try a new way of handling a project?
    * Do you give employees specific goals as well as the freedom to meet them in any way they choose?

4. **Frustration**: Significant differences between *Olympia* and *Santa Fe* meant the author didn't have deep technical knowledge/expertise to fall back on, "for the first time, I was truly curious. Walking the ship, I would ask questions about their equipment and what they were working on. They were skeptical about these questions initially, because normally I would have been 'questioning' (asking questions to make sure they knew the equipment), not curious. Now I was asking questions to make sure I knew the equipment. My unfamiliarity with the sub's technical details was having an interesting side effect: since I couldn't get involved with the specifics of the gear, I opened up space to focus on the people and their interactions instead, and to rely on the crew more than I normally would have. ... I started interviewing the chiefs and officers in their spaces. After having them tell me about their people, I asked them a loosely structured set of questions like:

    * What are the things you are hoping I don't change?
    * What are the things you secretly hope I do change?
    * What are the good things about *Santa Fe* we should build on?
    * If you were me what would you do first?
    * Why isn't the ship doing better?
    * What are your personal goals for your tour here on *Santa Fe*?
    * What impediments do you have to doing your job?
    * What will be our biggest challenge to getting *Santa Fe* ready for deployment?
    * What are your biggest frustrations about how *Santa Fe* is currently run?
    * What is the best thing I can do for you?

    "If you walk about your organization talking to people, I'd suggest that you be as curious as possible. As with a good dinner table conversationalist, one question should naturally lead to another. The time to be questioning or even critical is after trust has been established."

    Questions to consider:

    * Are you asking questions to make sure *you* know (curious), or to make sure *they* know (questioning)?
    * Do you have to be the smartest person in your organization?
    * To what degree does technical competence form the basis for leadership?
    * Is that technical competence a personal competence or an organizational competence?
    * How do you know what is going on "at the deck plate" in your organization?

    > This question of technical competence is critical to software management; there's a lot of important stuff he's talking about here about not needing to be the smartest person on the team/org/train/whatever. The other question about knowing what is going on "at the deck plate" (at the ground floor, at the base of the pyramid, etc) in the org is crucial.

5. **Call to Action**: Walking around, talking to crew members, getting "the lay of the land" instead of reviewing everything on the ship gives the author a view as to what's really going on.

    > It's in this chapter that he mentions buying a flashlight. "In order to do inspections properly, I'd ask them to bring me a flashlight. It wasn't supposed to be a test, but the flashlights were pitiful. Broken, dead batteries, dim bulbs--you couldn't see anything. I got myself a super Maglite that took four D-cell batteries. Its light was bright as the sun. I carried that flashlight around with me everywhere." (And he frequently mentions gesturing with it, like a field marshal's baton, in later chapters.) "Soon, others starting carrying flashlights that actually worked as well."

    The author observes frustration with the officers, who want to do better; the radio call log is being managed top-down, leaving no room for decisions by the officers or chiefs; during "quarters" (meeting of the men on the pier, standing in a rigid square), he walks around the periphery and can't hear the captain talking, and when asked, other sailors say the same but it "didn't matter, if there was something important, the chief would tell them at divisional quarters, a meeting that followed this meeting."

    "The overwhelming sense on the ship was that we needed to avoid problems. ... It was clear to me that whereas the *Olympia* crew wasn't as good as they thought they were, the *Santa Fe* crew wasn't as bad as they thought they were. There was a thirst to do better and an eagerness for change."

    Questions to consider:

    * Is there a call to action in your organization? Do people wish to change, or are they comfortable with the current level of performance?
    * Are things too comfortable?
    * Is there a feeling of complacency?
    * Do people take action to protect themselves or to make the outcome better? DOes leadership in your org take control or give control?

6. **"Whatever They Tell Me To Do"**: Author talks to one of the crew from an infamous photo of the *Santa Fe* showing slack and lack of focus; "'Hi, what do you do on board?' ... 'Whatever they tell me to do'. He knew he was a follower, and not happy with it, but he also was not taking responsibility. ... That was the attitude all over the ship. ... The problem was that the XO is the one who was being responsible for each department head's work, not the department head himself. Psychological ownership for accomplishing the work rested with the XO, not the department head. ... It is the department head, not the XO, who is responsible for the department head's job. This is leadership at all levels.

    "The department heads identified a potential problem with this approach: Who would be responsible and accountable for the work? If you, the captain, allow us to make decisions about the work, aren't you risking your professional reputation and career on how well we do? Isn't that the reason these ideas are so hard to implement? ... I would retain accountability for *Santa Fe*'s operational performance but release control of the actual decisions to the department heads."

    "Another thing bothered me as well. Who, exactly, was the 'they' in the statement 'whatever they tell me to do'? Wasn't 'they' us?"

    Questions to consider:

    * Why is doing what you are told appealing to some? Do people really just want to do as they are told?
    * If a snapshot of your business went viral on the Internet, what would it reveal about your workers?
    * Do your procedures reinforce the leader-follower model?
    * How would your middle managers react if you implemented a checkout system (like the one described in this chapter)?

7. **"I Relieve You"**: Author muses about the role of responsibility and the sharp boundaries the USN enforces: "If the ship started to sink right at that moment *[before he takes command]*, I would not be responsible. If it started to sink an hour later, it would be my responsibility, 100 percent. ... While that singular point of accountability is attractive in many ways, there is a downside. The previous commanding officer would not be held accountable. Thus, ... each CO is encouraged to maximize performance for his tour and his tour alone. There is no incentive or reward for developing mechanisms that enable excellence beyond your immeidate tour.

    "First, the crew wanted change, even if they didn't know quite how to do it. ... Second, we had an incredibly supportive chain of command. They were outcome-focused. ... Third, my reliance on the crew for the specifics of how the boat operated prevented me from falling into old habits and the trap of leader-follower. I couldn't have operated that way if I wanted to. ... Finally, it seemed clear that the crew was in a self-reinforcing downward spiral where poor practices resulted in mistakes, mistakes resulted in poor morale, and poor morale resulted in avoiding initiative and going into a survival mode of doing only what was absolutely necessary. In order to break this cycle, I'd need to radically change the daily motivation by shifting the focus from avoiding errors to achieving excellence."

    **Mechanism: Achieve Excellence, Don't Just Avoid Errors** (Clarity)

    "The best way not to make a mistake is not to do anything or make any decisions. ... focusing on avoiding errors is helpful for understanding the mechanics of procedures and detecting impending major problems before they occur, but it is a debilitating approach when adopted as the objective of an org. ***You are destined to fail.*** No matter how good you get at avoiding mistakes, you will always have errors on something as complex as a submarine. ... Focusing on avoiding mistakes takes our focus away from being truly exceptional. Once a ship has achieved success merely in the form of preventing major errors and is operating in a competent way, mission accomplished, there is no need to strive further. I resolved to change this. Our goal would be excellence instead of error reduction. We would focus on exceptional operational effectiveness for the submarine. We would achieve great things. Reducing mistakes would be an important side benefit to attaining our primary goal: achieving excellence."

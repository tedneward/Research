summary="A true story of turning followers into leaders." Management principles from a submarine captain.
~~~~~~
*(by L. David Marquet)*

"The core of the leader-leader model is giving employees *control* over what they work on and how they work. It means letting them make meaningful decisions. The two enabling pillars are *competence* and *clarity*."

***Control***

* Find the genetic code for control and rewrite it
* Act your way to new thinking
* Short, early conversations make efficient work
* Use "I intend to..." to turn passive followers into active leaders
* Resist the urge to provide solutions
* Eliminate top-down monitoring systems
* Think out loud (both superiors and subordinates)
* Embrace the inspectors

***Competence***

* Take deliberate action
* We learn (everywhere, all the time)
* Don't brief, certify
* Continually and consistently repeat the message
* Specify goals, not methods

***Clarity***

* Achieve excellence, don't just avoid errors
* Build trust and take care of your people
* Use your legacy for inspiration
* Use guiding principles for decision criteria
* Use immediate recognition to reinforce desired behaviors
* Begin with the end in mind
* Encourage a questioning attitude over blind obedience

Part I **Starting Over**: History and prelude to taking command of the *Sante Fe*.

1. **Pain**: Author's history aboard the *Will Rogers*; wanted to install leader-leader but met with failure, gave up; did some research. Found three contradictions:
    - "though I liked the idea of empowerment, I didn't understand why it was needed. ... humans are born in a state of action and natural empowerment. ... Additionally, it seemed inherently contradictory to have an empowerment program whereby I would empower my subordinates and my boss would empower me--I felt my power came from within, and attempts to empower me felt like manipulation."
    - "the way I was told to manage others was not the way I wanted to be managed. I felt I was at my best when given specific goals but broad latitude in how to accomplish them."
    - "I was disturbed by the close coupling of the technical competence of the leader with the performance of the organization. ... a good ship could become a bad ship overnight when a new CO came aboard."
    "Essentially, what I had been trying to achieve on *Will Rogers* was to ran an empowerment program within a leader-follower structure." *"One of the things that limits our learning is our belief that we already know something."*

Questions to consider:

* Why do we need empowerment? Do you need someone else to empower you?
* How reliant is your organization on the decision making of one person, or a small group of people?
* What kind of leadership model does your business or organization use?
* When you think of movie images that depict leadership, who/what comes to mind? What assumptions are embedded in those images? How do these images influence how you think about yourself as a leader? To what extent do these images limit your growth as a leader?

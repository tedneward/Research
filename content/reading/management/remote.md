[GitLab's Guide to All-Remote](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/): **The Remote Manifesto**: All-remote work promotes:

    * Hiring and working from all over the world (instead of from a central location).
    * Flexible working hours (over set working hours).
    * Writing down and recording knowledge (over verbal explanations).
    * Written processes (over on-the-job training).
    * Public sharing of information (over need-to-know access).
    * Opening up documents for editing by anyone (over top-down control of documents).
    * Asynchronous communication (over synchronous communication).
    * The results of work (over the hours put in).
    * Formal communication channels (over informal communication channels).

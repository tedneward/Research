# Introduction: Stop Beating Your People with Carrots
"Are you motivated to read this book? ... This is simply the wrong question. What if I asked instead, Why are you motivated to read this book? ... An important truth emerges when we explore the nature of motivation. *People are always motivated.* The question is not *if*, but *why* they are motivated.

* Motivation that comes from *choosing* to do smoething is different from motivation that comes from *having* to do it.

* Motivation generated from values, purpose, love, joy, or compassion is different from motivation generated from ego, power, status, or a desire for external rewards.

* Motivation to compete because of a desire to excel (where the score serves as feedback for how successfully you are growing, learning, and executing) is different from competing for the sake of besting someone else, to impress, or to gain favors.

"When it comes to motivation, assuming that more is better, is too simplistic and even unwise. As with friends, it isn't how many friends you have, it is the quality and types of friendships that matter."

Why aren't more leaders making use of the better way to approach motivation?

* You are not aware of the evidence. [Behaviorist theory, a la B.F. Skinner, was how we understood motivation.] *People are not pigeons.*

* You don't believe the evidence. [Embedded beliefs about management--"The purpose of business is to ____", "It's not personal, it's just ___", and so on.]

* You don't know what to do with the evidence. Fear and trepidation: *What are alternatives to abandoning the stick and weaning people off the carrot? How do I get and keep people intrinsically motivated?* But... *Misunderstanding what motivation means leads to a misapplication of techniques to make it happen.*

# Chapter 1: The Motivation Dilemma
[Billy Beane, the Moneyball GM for the A's; the Boston Red Sox tried to lure him away with massive paycheck and perks, and he turned them down. He was motivated, just motivated differently than one might expect.]

The motivation dilemma is that leaders are being held accountable to do something they cannot do: motivate others.

## The Appraisal Process: How Motivation Happens

**Why do we say that people are already motivated?** Assuming that people lack motivation at any time is a mistake! They have appraised the situation, come to their own conclusions, and gone in their own motivational direction. They (and you) have cognitive and emotional responses to the meeting: *Is the meeting a safe or threatening event? Am I feeling supported or threatened? Is it a good use or waste of my time? Am I excited or fearful? Am I attending because I want to, or because I feel I have to?* Ultimately, how you feel about the meeting has the greatest influence on your sense of well-being, which determines your intentions, which ultimately lead to your behavior.

**The heart of employee engagement.** The appraisal process is the heart of employee engagement/disengagement; but *how* do people come to be engaged? (How could you improve engagement scores if you don't understand the internal process individuals go through to become engaged?) Researchers have discovered a higher level of engagement behind disengaged, actively disengaged, and engaged employees: *employee work passion*, which demonstrates these five positive intentions:

* Performs above standard expectations.

* Uses discretionary effort on behalf of the organization.

* Endorses the organization and its leadership to others outside the organization.

* Uses altruistic citizenship behaviors toward all stakeholders.

* Stays with the organization.

Researchers identified twelve organizational/job factors that influence a person's positive appraisal process.

*Motivating people may not work, but you can help facilitate people's appraisal process so they are more likely to experience day-to-day optimal motivation.* ***Motivation is a skill. People can learn to choose and create optimal motivational experiences anytime and anywhere.*** But before you can help your people navigate their appraisal process or teach them the skill of motivation, you need to master it yourself.

**A spectrum of motivation.** [Spectrum of Motivation model--six motivational outlooks]

* *Disinterested motivational outlook.* (Suboptimal) You simply could not find any value in the meeting; it felt like a waste of time, adding to your sense of feeling overwhelmed.

* *External motivational outlook.* (Suboptimal) The meeting provded an opportunity for you to exert your position or power; it enabled you to take advantage of a primse for more money or an enhanced status or image in the eyes of others.

* *Imposed motivational outlook.* (Suboptimal) You felt pressured because everyone else was attending and expected the same from you; you were avoiding feelings of guilt, shame, or fear from not participating.

* *Aligned motivational outlook.* (Optimal) You were able to link the meeting to a significant value, such as learning--hat you might learn or what others might learn from you.

* *Integrated motivational outlook.* (Optimal) You were able to link the meeting to a life or work purpose, such as giving voice to an important issue in the meeting.

* *Inherent motivational outlook.* (Optimal) You simply enjoy meetings and thought it would be fun.

**The Problem with Feeding People Motivational Junk Food.** [Steady diet of junk food simply isn't good for us.] A study: You receive an invitation from your health insurance provider: Lose weight, win an iPad. Many did, lost weight, won the iPad. But researchers followed the participants past the prize, and noticed that within 12 weeks, people resumed old behaviors, regained the weight they had lost, and then added even more weight. Financial incentives do not sustain changes in personal health behaviors--in fact they undermine those behaviors over time. They may help initiate new and healthy behaviors, but they fail miserably in helping people maintain their progress or sustain results.

**Try Serving Motivational Health Food.** People with high-quality motivation may accept external rewards when offered, but this is clearly *not the reason* for their efforts. The reasons these people do what they do are more profound and provide more satisfaction than external rewards can deliver.

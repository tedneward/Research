# Introduction: Stop Beating Your People with Carrots
"Are you motivated to read this book? ... This is simply the wrong question. What if I asked instead, Why are you motivated to read this book? ... An important truth emerges when we explore the nature of motivation. *People are always motivated.* The question is not *if*, but *why* they are motivated.

* Motivation that comes from *choosing* to do smoething is different from motivation that comes from *having* to do it.

* Motivation generated from values, purpose, love, joy, or compassion is different from motivation generated from ego, power, status, or a desire for external rewards.

* Motivation to compete because of a desire to excel (where the score serves as feedback for how successfully you are growing, learning, and executing) is different from competing for the sake of besting someone else, to impress, or to gain favors.

"When it comes to motivation, assuming that more is better, is too simplistic and even unwise. As with friends, it isn't how many friends you have, it is the quality and types of friendships that matter."

Why aren't more leaders making use of the better way to approach motivation?

* You are not aware of the evidence. [Behaviorist theory, a la B.F. Skinner, was how we understood motivation.] *People are not pigeons.*

* You don't believe the evidence. [Embedded beliefs about management--"The purpose of business is to ____", "It's not personal, it's just ___", and so on.]

* You don't know what to do with the evidence. Fear and trepidation: *What are alternatives to abandoning the stick and weaning people off the carrot? How do I get and keep people intrinsically motivated?* But... *Misunderstanding what motivation means leads to a misapplication of techniques to make it happen.*

# Chapter 1: The Motivation Dilemma
[Billy Beane, the Moneyball GM for the A's; the Boston Red Sox tried to lure him away with massive paycheck and perks, and he turned them down. He was motivated, just motivated differently than one might expect.]

The motivation dilemma is that leaders are being held accountable to do something they cannot do: motivate others.

**Why do we say that people are already motivated?** Assuming that people lack motivation at any time is a mistake! They have appraised the situation, come to their own conclusions, and gone in their own motivational direction. They (and you) have cognitive and emotional responses to the meeting: *Is the meeting a safe or threatening event? Am I feeling supported or threatened? Is it a good use or waste of my time? Am I excited or fearful? Am I attending because I want to, or because I feel I have to?* Ultimately, how you feel about the meeting has the greatest influence on your sense of well-being, which determines your intentions, which ultimately lead to your behavior.

**The heart of employee engagement.** The appraisal process is the heart of employee engagement/disengagement; but *how* do people come to be engaged? (How could you improve engagement scores if you don't understand the internal process individuals go through to become engaged?) Researchers have discovered a higher level of engagement behind disengaged, actively disengaged, and engaged employees: *employee work passion*, which demonstrates these five positive intentions:

* Performs above standard expectations.

* Uses discretionary effort on behalf of the organization.

* Endorses the organization and its leadership to others outside the organization.

* Uses altruistic citizenship behaviors toward all stakeholders.

* Stays with the organization.

Researchers identified twelve organizational/job factors that influence a person's positive appraisal process.

*Motivating people may not work, but you can help facilitate people's appraisal process so they are more likely to experience day-to-day optimal motivation.* ***Motivation is a skill. People can learn to choose and create optimal motivational experiences anytime and anywhere.*** But before you can help your people navigate their appraisal process or teach them the skill of motivation, you need to master it yourself.

**A spectrum of motivation.** [Spectrum of Motivation model--six motivational outlooks]

* *Disinterested motivational outlook.* (Suboptimal) You simply could not find any value in the meeting; it felt like a waste of time, adding to your sense of feeling overwhelmed.

* *External motivational outlook.* (Suboptimal) The meeting provded an opportunity for you to exert your position or power; it enabled you to take advantage of a primse for more money or an enhanced status or image in the eyes of others.

* *Imposed motivational outlook.* (Suboptimal) You felt pressured because everyone else was attending and expected the same from you; you were avoiding feelings of guilt, shame, or fear from not participating.

* *Aligned motivational outlook.* (Optimal) You were able to link the meeting to a significant value, such as learning--hat you might learn or what others might learn from you.

* *Integrated motivational outlook.* (Optimal) You were able to link the meeting to a life or work purpose, such as giving voice to an important issue in the meeting.

* *Inherent motivational outlook.* (Optimal) You simply enjoy meetings and thought it would be fun.

**The Problem with Feeding People Motivational Junk Food.** [Steady diet of junk food simply isn't good for us.] A study: You receive an invitation from your health insurance provider: Lose weight, win an iPad. Many did, lost weight, won the iPad. But researchers followed the participants past the prize, and noticed that within 12 weeks, people resumed old behaviors, regained the weight they had lost, and then added even more weight. Financial incentives do not sustain changes in personal health behaviors--in fact they undermine those behaviors over time. They may help initiate new and healthy behaviors, but they fail miserably in helping people maintain their progress or sustain results.

**Try Serving Motivational Health Food.** People with high-quality motivation may accept external rewards when offered, but this is clearly *not the reason* for their efforts. The reasons these people do what they do are more profound and provide more satisfaction than external rewards can deliver.

# Chapter 2: What Motivates People: The Real Story
Human beings have an innate tendency and desire to thrive, but thriving doesn't happen automatically. Human thriving in the workplace is a dynamic potential that requires nurturing.

**Illuminating the True Nature of Human Motivation.** The essence of the answer lies in three psychological needs: *autonomy*, *relatedness*, and *competence* (ARC).

* ***Autonomy*** *Autonomy is our human need to perceive we have choices. It is our need to feel that what we are doing is of our own volition. It is our perception that we are the source of our actions.* Children demonstrate a core need for autonomy; adults never lose their psychological need for autonomy. Employees experience autonomy when they feel some control and choice about the work they do. Autonomy doesn't mean that managers are permissive or hands-off but rather that employees feel they have influence in the workplace. Whether they are formally empowered or not, people can choose their own level of autonomy. ["If You Want to Motivate Someone, Shut Up Already"](https://hbr.org/2013/07/if-you-want-to-motivate-someone-shut-up-already) (by Brandon Irwin) when a sports/training coach is verbally encouraging a trainee, performance is significantly lower than the results achieved with a quiet but attentive coach; hypothesis is that verbacl encouragement externalizes the exercisers' attention and energy, which blocks the exercisers' sense of autonomy.

* ***Relatedness*** *Relatedness is our need to care about and be cared about by others. It is our need to feel connected to others without concerns about ulterior motives. It is our need to feel that we are contributing to something greater than ourselves.* It is personal, interpersonal, and social; we thrive on connection. If your need for relatedness is not met at work, and over 75% of your time is connected to work, then where is it being met? There is no such thing as "compensatory need satisfaction"--need satisfaction is important for everyone, all the time, and everywhere. One of the great opportunities you have as a leader is to help your people find meaning, contribute to a social purpose, and experience healthy interpersonal relationships at work. The role you play as a leader is helping people experience relatedness at work: *caring about and feeling cared about, feeling connected without ulterior motives, and contributing to something greater than oneself.* Your people will feel the opposite of relatedness if they think they're being used by you or the organization, sense that your attention is not genuine, or suspect they are simply a means to someone else's ends.

* ***Competence*** *Competence is our need to feel effective at meeting everyday challenges and opportunities. It is demonstrating skill over time. It is a feeling a sense of growth and flourishing.* Children have a psychological need to learn and grow; bribing children with carrots or driving them with sticks diverts them from their natural love of learning. Children who succumbed to ineffective motivational techniques for learning and growing are now in the workplace hooked on motivational junk food in the form of pay-for-performance plans and elaborate reward and incentive programs. You can't impose growth and learning on a person, but you can promote a learning environment that doesn't undermine your people's sense of competence.

# Chapter 3: The Danger of Drive

Be careful of being driven; if you are driven, who is doing the driving?

Drive Theory (popular motivational theory) is based on the idea that we are motivated to get what we don't have: if you are thirsty you are driven to drink, if you are hungry you are driven to eat. The problem is that after you drink or eat, your need is satiated and you are no longer to drink or eat until your body is deficient again.

**Anti-Drive Theory.** Your psychological needs are not drives; they are just the opposite, in that drives dissipate when they are satiated. When psychological needs are satisfied, you experience such positive energy, vitality, and a sense of well-being that you want more. *People who experience ARC are thriving. They do not need something or someone else doing the driving.* Dysfunction exists because our psychological needs for ARC are not being satisfied.

**Self-Regulation: The Means to a Satisfying End.** Psychological needs are fragile; their power is in the combined potency of ARC--but if one is out of balance, the others are diminished. How do we protect our psychological needs from all these distractions? Self-regulation: *mindfully managing feelings, thoughts, values, and purpose for immediate and sustained positive effort.*

**The Nature of Self-Regulation: Eating the Marshmallow.** [The Stanford Marshmallow experiment.] Study: "teachers" set up an art project to explore why some children demonstrate higher-quality self-regulation than others. Children were told they had a choice to either start their art project immediately with a few materials on hand, or wait until a teacher came back with a big bag of art supplies, which then put them into one of two scenarios--a reliable situation (the teacher always came back with the big bag of supplies) and an unreliable situation (the teacher returned with no supplies at all). The letdown of not getting bigger and better supplies as promised made them less likely to engage enthusiastically in their art. Then, the teacher announced that it was time for a snack, and the children were given the "one marshmallow now, or wait for the teacher to come back with two marshmallows" decision. Children in the reliable group (who had received their art supplies as promised) had four times longer delayed gratification than the children who experienced the unreliable situation. *The quality of the children's self-regulation significantly correlated to their environment and experience.*

**The MVPs of Self-Regulation.**

* ***Mindfulness.*** *Mindfulness is noticing--being aware and attuned to what is happening in the present moment without judgment or an automatic reaction. It is a state of being but is also a skill that requires development through practice and patience.* Mindfulness and ARC are directly linked. The high-quality self-regulation that comes from mindfulness is highly relevant to a person's motivational outlook. The more mindful you are, the more likely you are to satisfy your psychological needs. When a person is mindful, she experiences a heightened sense of *autonomy* because she is not controlled by her own potentially misconstrued and misaligned self-concept based on irrelevant past experiences. In this mindful state, a person is better able to experience *relatedness* because she can be genuinely concerned about another person without self-serving interpretations or prejudice. Mindfulness also enhances her *competence* because without the knee-jerk response, she has options for making more appropriate choices--she is better able to navigate and master whatever situation she finds herself in.

* ***Values.*** *Values are premeditated, cognitive standards of what a person considers good or bad, worse, better, or best. Values are enduring beliefs a person has chosen to accept as guidelines for how he works--and lives his life.* Individuals need to identify, develop, clarify, declare, and operationalize their own work-related values and purpose--and then determine how they align with the organization's values. Employees with clarified values are more likely to experience high-quality self-regulation despite inevitable workplace demands and challenges. But therein lies the problem: First people need to have developed values! People are always acting from their values, what matters is the *quality* of their values. Developing workplace values for yourself and with your people is worth the investment of time--linking developed values to a challenging task, goal, or situation activates a shift between a suboptimal motivational outlook and optimal motivational outlook. A developed value is freely chosen from alternatives, with an understanding of the consequences of the alternatives; it is acted upon over time.

* ***Purpose.*** *Purpose is a deep and meaningful reason for doing something. Purpose is acting with a noble intention--when your actions are infused with social significance.* *Peak performers are not goal driven. Peak performers are values based and inspired by a noble purpose.* The danger of drive is that it distracts people from what really makes them dance. People are more likely to meet or exceed expectations when they pursue goals within a context of meaningful purpose. Employees who have clarified their personal values and vision and integrated them with their organization's stated values and vision are likely to be living, working, and even dancing purposefully. Most organizations have a vision, mission, or purpose statement, but few employees have one for their work-related role. Collaborate with your employees to find alignment between their perception of their role-related values and purpose and your perception. Come to conclusions together that meet both their needs and those of the organization.

**The Danger of Drive.** It promotes external motivators that undermine people's psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence--diminishing the quality and sustainability of their motivation. When employees focus on an external motivator, they are controlled by it, or whoever is doing the driving, and without realizing it, they lose autonomy. People ultimately resent leaders who create a pressurized workplace that undermines autonomy. People regard managers who drive for results as self-serving; they consider support by those managers as conditional (if you do as I say, then I will reward you in some way) and that undermines people's relatedness. Driving for results by adding pressure and tension blocks people's creativity and ability to focus, leaving them feeling inadequate or ineffective at coping with circumstances--which undermines competence.

When employees thrive, leaders don't need to drive.

# Chapter 4: Motivation is a Skill
Three skills are needed for activating your own positive energy, vitality, and sense of well-being:
* *Identify your current motivational outlook* by recognizing and understanding your sense of well-being and your underlying reasons for doing what you are doing.
* *Shift to (or maintain) an optimal motivational outlook* by using the MVPs of self-regulation to satisfy your psychological needs for ARC.
* *Reflect* by noticing the difference between having a suboptimal motivational outlook and having an optimal motivational outlook.

Leaders must understand how to do it for themselves before they can hope to guide others. *Teaching leaders about motivation is difficult because they believe their job is to motivate others--not themselves.*

# "Meeting the Challenge of Disruptive Change"
(by Clayton M Christensen and Michael Overdorf)

Why do so few established companies innovate successfully? When a new venture captures the established firms' imagination, they get their people working on it within organizational structures (such as functional teams) designed to surmount old challenges--not ones that the new venture is facing. To avoid this mistake, ask:

* **"Does my organization have the right resources to support this innovation?"** Resources supporting business-as-usual (people, technologies, product designs, brands, customer and supplier relationships) rarely match those required for new ventures.

* **"Does my organization have the right processes to innovate?"** Processes supporting your established business (decision-making protocols, coordination patterns) may hamstring the new venture.

* **"Does my organization have the right values to innovate?"** Consider how you decide whether to commit to a new venture. For example, can you tolerate lower profit margins than your established enterprise demands?

* **"What team and structure will best support our innovation effort?"** Should you use a team dedicated to the project within your company? Create a separate spin-off organization?

By selecting the right team and organizational structure for your innovation--and infusing it with the right resources, processes, and values--you heighten your chances of innovating successfully.

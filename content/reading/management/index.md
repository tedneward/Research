#### 9 Questions for 1:1s
(by Claire Lew, CEO of [KnowYourCompany](http://knowyourteam.com))

1. "Are you afraid of anything at work?"
2. "Have you seen something recently and thought to yourself 'I wish we'd done that'?"
3. "Is there something we should measure in the company that we currently don't?"
4. "Is there any part of the company you wish you were able to interact with more?"
5. "Are there any benefits we don't offer that you'd like to see us offer?"
6. "Is there an area outside your current role where you feel you could be contributing?"
7. "Is there anyone at the company you wish you could apprentice under for a few weeks?"
8. "Have you seen someone here do great work that's gone unnoticed?"
9. "Are there things you don't know about the company that you feel you should know?"

#### Ashlee Clifton (Rocket Mortgage) uses these to open 1:1s with people.

* My personal Beliefs and expectations that carry into work - These are your personal ISMs.  List your beliefs and expectations so it is clear for your team members what you expect.

* My personal and work fears - List here what is always in the back of your mind.  Show them you are vulnerable you are not all sunshine and rainbows.

* Best Ways I learn - Let them know how you like to learn, receive feedback, etc.   This will help open the lines of communication and get you started on the right page.

* I am motivated by (Goals, Praise) - Let the person know what motivates you, so they can help.  How do you like to receive recognition?

* ["A Simple Framework for Software Engineering Management"](https://medium.com/swlh/a-simple-framework-for-software-engineering-management-f70b216540f2): Responsibilities (people management, delivery leadership, technical system ownership) in a 2-axis grid with priorities (issues, things that are OK, ideas/aspirations). "To sum up, we can look at software engineering management as a combination of three areas of responsibilities: *people management*, *delivery leadership*, and *technical system ownership*. Paying attention to all three responsibilities is important. However the amount of attention each responsibility should get depends on the team, the organisation, the product, and other factors. It also changes over time. Within each responsibility area we can identify issues, things that are okay, as well as ideas and aspirations. Things that are already okay only need to be acknowledged. Issues need to be prioritised and promptly resolved. Ideas and aspirations should be evaluated and, if deemed relevant, executed or put on the roadmap."

* ["5 Things High-Performing Teams Do Differently"](https://hbr.org/2021/10/5-things-high-performing-teams-do-differently)

    1. High-Performing Teams Are Not Afraid to Pick Up the Phone (communicate more frequently)
    2. High-Performing Teams Are More Strategic With Their Meetings (avoid poor meetings by requiring prework from participants; introduce an agenda; begin with a check-in that keeps team members apprised of one another's progress)
    3. High-Performing Teams Invest Time Bonding Over Non-Work Topics (high-performing team members are significantly more likely to spend time at the office discussing non-work matters with their colleagues (25% more) — topics that may extend to sports, books, and family)
    4. High-Performing Teams Give and Receive Appreciation More Frequently (within the best teams, appreciation doesn’t flow from the top down. It’s a cultural norm that’s observable in peer-to-peer interactions)
    5. High-Performing Teams Are More Authentic at Work (high-performing teams were significantly more likely to express positive emotions with their colleagues; interestingly, however, they were also more likely to express negative emotions at work. Why would expressing negative emotions at work yield more positive performance? It’s because the alternative to expressing negative emotions is suppressing them, and suppression is cognitively expensive. It involves expending valuable cognitive resources attempting to hide emotions from others, leaving less mental firepower for doing the work.)

* ["Are Emily and Greg More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination"](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873): "We perform a field experiment to measure racial discrimination in the labor market. We respond with fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perception of race, each resume is assigned either a very African American sounding name or a very White sounding name. The results show significant discrimination against African-American names: White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. We also find that race affects the benefits of a better resume. ***For White names, a higher quality resume elicits 30 percent more callbacks whereas for African Americans, it elicits a far smaller increase. Applicants living in better neighborhoods receive more callbacks but, interestingly, this effect does not differ by race.*** The amount of discrimination is uniform across occupations and industries. Federal contractors and employers who list Equal Opportunity Employer' in their ad discriminate as much as other employers. We find little evidence that our results are driven by employers inferring something other than race, such as social class, from the names. These results suggest that racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market."

* ["Does Stress Impact Technical Interviews?"](https://chrisparnin.me/pdf/stress_FSE_20.pdf): "Software engineering candidates commonly participate in whiteboard technical interviews as part of a hiring assessment. During these sessions, candidates write code while thinking-aloud as they work towards a solution, under the watchful eye of an interviewer. While technical interviews should allow for an unbiased and inclusive assessment of problem-solving ability, surprisingly, another possibility is that technical interviews are instead a procedure for identifying candidates who best handle and migrate stress solely caused by being examined by an interviewer (performance anxiety). To understand if coding interviews—as administered today—can induce stress that significantly hinders performance, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with 48 Computer Science students, comparing them in private and public whiteboard settings. We found that performance is reduced by more than half, by simply being watched by an interviewer. We also observed that stress and cognitive load were significantly higher in a traditional technical interview when compared with our private interview. Consequently, interviewers may be filtering out qualified candidates by confounding assessment of problem-solving ability with unnecessary stress. We propose interview modifications to make problem-solving assessment more equitable and inclusive, such as through private focus sessions and retrospective think-aloud, allowing companies to hire from a larger and diverse pool of talent."

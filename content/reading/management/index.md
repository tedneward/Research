#### 9 Questions for 1:1s
(by Claire Lew, CEO of [KnowYourCompany](http://knowyourteam.com))

1. "Are you afraid of anything at work?"
2. "Have you seen something recently and thought to yourself 'I wish we'd done that'?"
3. "Is there something we should measure in the company that we currently don't?"
4. "Is there any part of the company you wish you were able to interact with more?"
5. "Are there any benefits we don't offer that you'd like to see us offer?"
6. "Is there an area outside your current role where you feel you could be contributing?"
7. "Is there anyone at the company you wish you could apprentice under for a few weeks?"
8. "Have you seen someone here do great work that's gone unnoticed?"
9. "Are there things you don't know about the company that you feel you should know?"

#### Ashlee Clifton (Rocket Mortgage) uses these to open 1:1s with people.

* My personal Beliefs and expectations that carry into work - These are your personal ISMs.  List your beliefs and expectations so it is clear for your team members what you expect.

* My personal and work fears - List here what is always in the back of your mind.  Show them you are vulnerable you are not all sunshine and rainbows.

* Best Ways I learn - Let them know how you like to learn, receive feedback, etc.   This will help open the lines of communication and get you started on the right page.

* I am motivated by (Goals, Praise) - Let the person know what motivates you, so they can help.  How do you like to receive recognition?

* ["A Simple Framework for Software Engineering Management"](https://medium.com/swlh/a-simple-framework-for-software-engineering-management-f70b216540f2): Responsibilities (people management, delivery leadership, technical system ownership) in a 2-axis grid with priorities (issues, things that are OK, ideas/aspirations). "To sum up, we can look at software engineering management as a combination of three areas of responsibilities: *people management*, *delivery leadership*, and *technical system ownership*. Paying attention to all three responsibilities is important. However the amount of attention each responsibility should get depends on the team, the organisation, the product, and other factors. It also changes over time. Within each responsibility area we can identify issues, things that are okay, as well as ideas and aspirations. Things that are already okay only need to be acknowledged. Issues need to be prioritised and promptly resolved. Ideas and aspirations should be evaluated and, if deemed relevant, executed or put on the roadmap."

* ["5 Things High-Performing Teams Do Differently"](https://hbr.org/2021/10/5-things-high-performing-teams-do-differently)

    1. High-Performing Teams Are Not Afraid to Pick Up the Phone (communicate more frequently)
    2. High-Performing Teams Are More Strategic With Their Meetings (avoid poor meetings by requiring prework from participants; introduce an agenda; begin with a check-in that keeps team members apprised of one another's progress)
    3. High-Performing Teams Invest Time Bonding Over Non-Work Topics (high-performing team members are significantly more likely to spend time at the office discussing non-work matters with their colleagues (25% more) — topics that may extend to sports, books, and family)
    4. High-Performing Teams Give and Receive Appreciation More Frequently (within the best teams, appreciation doesn’t flow from the top down. It’s a cultural norm that’s observable in peer-to-peer interactions)
    5. High-Performing Teams Are More Authentic at Work (high-performing teams were significantly more likely to express positive emotions with their colleagues; interestingly, however, they were also more likely to express negative emotions at work. Why would expressing negative emotions at work yield more positive performance? It’s because the alternative to expressing negative emotions is suppressing them, and suppression is cognitively expensive. It involves expending valuable cognitive resources attempting to hide emotions from others, leaving less mental firepower for doing the work.)

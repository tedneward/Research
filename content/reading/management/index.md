## 1:1 meetings

[Plucky 1:1 Starter Pack](https://shop.beplucky.com/products/the-plucky-1-1-starter-pack) | [Plucky 1:1 Manager Pack](https://shop.beplucky.com/products/1-1-manager-pack): "Conversation cards" for those awkward moments of silence in a 1:1. Highly recommended.

[T-Shaped People and Academia](https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2022/t/): "... academia is doing a disservice to ‘T-shaped persons,’ i.e. persons combining deep expertise in one or more fields with an ability to collaborate across areas. T-shaped persons are often contrasted with I-shaped persons, commonly known as experts. Given the state of the art in the software industry, T-shaped people are a sought-for commodity: the current ‘framework du jour’ might be obsolete in a few years, but the horizontal bar of a T-shaped person ensures that they can also contribute to other aspects of a project, and quite likely will develop new vertical bars, i.e. new expertise over time."

#### 9 Questions for 1:1s
(by Claire Lew, CEO of [KnowYourCompany](http://knowyourteam.com))

1. "Are you afraid of anything at work?"
2. "Have you seen something recently and thought to yourself 'I wish we'd done that'?"
3. "Is there something we should measure in the company that we currently don't?"
4. "Is there any part of the company you wish you were able to interact with more?"
5. "Are there any benefits we don't offer that you'd like to see us offer?"
6. "Is there an area outside your current role where you feel you could be contributing?"
7. "Is there anyone at the company you wish you could apprentice under for a few weeks?"
8. "Have you seen someone here do great work that's gone unnoticed?"
9. "Are there things you don't know about the company that you feel you should know?"

#### Ashlee Clifton (Rocket Mortgage) uses these to open 1:1s with people.

* My personal Beliefs and expectations that carry into work - These are your personal ISMs.  List your beliefs and expectations so it is clear for your team members what you expect.

* My personal and work fears - List here what is always in the back of your mind.  Show them you are vulnerable you are not all sunshine and rainbows.

* Best Ways I learn - Let them know how you like to learn, receive feedback, etc.   This will help open the lines of communication and get you started on the right page.

* I am motivated by (Goals, Praise) - Let the person know what motivates you, so they can help.  How do you like to receive recognition?

* ["A Simple Framework for Software Engineering Management"](https://medium.com/swlh/a-simple-framework-for-software-engineering-management-f70b216540f2): Responsibilities (people management, delivery leadership, technical system ownership) in a 2-axis grid with priorities (issues, things that are OK, ideas/aspirations). "To sum up, we can look at software engineering management as a combination of three areas of responsibilities: *people management*, *delivery leadership*, and *technical system ownership*. Paying attention to all three responsibilities is important. However the amount of attention each responsibility should get depends on the team, the organisation, the product, and other factors. It also changes over time. Within each responsibility area we can identify issues, things that are okay, as well as ideas and aspirations. Things that are already okay only need to be acknowledged. Issues need to be prioritised and promptly resolved. Ideas and aspirations should be evaluated and, if deemed relevant, executed or put on the roadmap."

* ["5 Things High-Performing Teams Do Differently"](https://hbr.org/2021/10/5-things-high-performing-teams-do-differently)

    1. High-Performing Teams Are Not Afraid to Pick Up the Phone (communicate more frequently)
    2. High-Performing Teams Are More Strategic With Their Meetings (avoid poor meetings by requiring prework from participants; introduce an agenda; begin with a check-in that keeps team members apprised of one another's progress)
    3. High-Performing Teams Invest Time Bonding Over Non-Work Topics (high-performing team members are significantly more likely to spend time at the office discussing non-work matters with their colleagues (25% more) — topics that may extend to sports, books, and family)
    4. High-Performing Teams Give and Receive Appreciation More Frequently (within the best teams, appreciation doesn’t flow from the top down. It’s a cultural norm that’s observable in peer-to-peer interactions)
    5. High-Performing Teams Are More Authentic at Work (high-performing teams were significantly more likely to express positive emotions with their colleagues; interestingly, however, they were also more likely to express negative emotions at work. Why would expressing negative emotions at work yield more positive performance? It’s because the alternative to expressing negative emotions is suppressing them, and suppression is cognitively expensive. It involves expending valuable cognitive resources attempting to hide emotions from others, leaving less mental firepower for doing the work.)

* ["Are Emily and Greg More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination"](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873): "We perform a field experiment to measure racial discrimination in the labor market. We respond with fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perception of race, each resume is assigned either a very African American sounding name or a very White sounding name. The results show significant discrimination against African-American names: White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. We also find that race affects the benefits of a better resume. ***For White names, a higher quality resume elicits 30 percent more callbacks whereas for African Americans, it elicits a far smaller increase. Applicants living in better neighborhoods receive more callbacks but, interestingly, this effect does not differ by race.*** The amount of discrimination is uniform across occupations and industries. Federal contractors and employers who list Equal Opportunity Employer' in their ad discriminate as much as other employers. We find little evidence that our results are driven by employers inferring something other than race, such as social class, from the names. These results suggest that racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market."

* ["Does Stress Impact Technical Interviews?"](https://chrisparnin.me/pdf/stress_FSE_20.pdf): "Software engineering candidates commonly participate in whiteboard technical interviews as part of a hiring assessment. During these sessions, candidates write code while thinking-aloud as they work towards a solution, under the watchful eye of an interviewer. While technical interviews should allow for an unbiased and inclusive assessment of problem-solving ability, surprisingly, another possibility is that technical interviews are instead a procedure for identifying candidates who best handle and migrate stress solely caused by being examined by an interviewer (performance anxiety). To understand if coding interviews—as administered today—can induce stress that significantly hinders performance, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with 48 Computer Science students, comparing them in private and public whiteboard settings. We found that performance is reduced by more than half, by simply being watched by an interviewer. We also observed that stress and cognitive load were significantly higher in a traditional technical interview when compared with our private interview. Consequently, interviewers may be filtering out qualified candidates by confounding assessment of problem-solving ability with unnecessary stress. We propose interview modifications to make problem-solving assessment more equitable and inclusive, such as through private focus sessions and retrospective think-aloud, allowing companies to hire from a larger and diverse pool of talent."

* [Twitter thread: "Here are 12 things your manager may not be telling you, but I know for a fact will help you."](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1478241311392108545):

    1. As a software engineer, you are not there to take requirements blindly. You are there to partner with your business and product partners. That means you have to earn an equal seat at the table on product decisions.
    2. Being smart or good at what you do does not give you the right to be a jerk. Empathy as an engineer is a superpower. Caring about those you work with will do more for your career than writing beautiful defect-free code.
    3. As someone in the code, every day, you will see things that others will never see. You will know what's possible; they'll guess what's possible. Some of the best product features are born because engineers found clever ways to solve something. Look out for those things.
    4. You are there to add value first. All the code you wrote will end up in the recycling bin of some computer if it does not add value directly or indirectly to the business. It doesn't matter how pretty your code is or how much you love it if it doesn't add value.
    5. Your code should follow this pattern:

        1. Make it work
        2. Make it fast
        3. Make it beautiful 
        
        Reminder: You won't have a chance to make it fast or beautiful if it doesn't add value.
    6. Build relationships with engineers in other teams and other companies. Learn about the problems they are solving. Learn different architecture and designs than the ones your team uses. You never know when their solutions will save you days of work.
    7. You don't need permission to add value. If you see something and know you can fix or improve it, do it. Nobody will ever say to you, "why did you add all that value? WTF is wrong with you!?" Every time I've done that unexpectedly, I've earned outsized rewards.
    8. 10x engineers do exist and so do .1x engineers too. If you think they don’t exist, that’s just because you haven’t worked with any of them yet. *(I disagree with this one immensely, and I despise the "that's just because you haven't worked with one yet" coda that essentially tries to abort any disagreement ahead of time.)*
    9. Just because you think someone shouldn’t be hired, that does not mean they aren’t a good engineer. It also does not mean they don’t have a strong work ethic. A strong work ethic is the most important thing, and it's nearly impossible to tease out in an interview.
    10. Advocate for junior engineers. My friend @VicVijayakumar reminded me that just because they don't have 10+ years of experience does not mean they won't be good. Without junior engineers on the team, no one will grow. Help others grow; you'll grow too.
    11. Have empathy for the people you interview. You could be in that situation. The set of things to know is large, even if you only ask basics. Plus, on a whiteboard, the other person is being judged. They have a lot to lose, maybe hundreds of thousands in income.
    12. Even though you work with computers, your career and future depend on people. Until AI runs things, people still run the world, and relationships matter a lot. Build relationships with people outside of engineering, listen to their problems. It will change your trajectory. *(AI won't run things; or, arguably, computers are already running things. It won't change much aside from scope and a gently-increasing distance from the manufacturing cycle. But humans will never give up some level of control, we're too egotistical for that.)*

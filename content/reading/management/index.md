Employing a non-binary gender identification built on usernames, I investigate the role of gender in shaping users’ experience in technical forums. The analysis encompasses 11-years of activity, across levels of expertise, language, and specialism, to assess if Stack Overflow is really a paradise for programmers. I first examine individual users, asking if there are gender differences in key user metrics of success, focusing on reputation points, user tenure, and level of activity. Second, I test if there are gender-biases in how technical knowledge is recognised in the question-answer format of the platform. Third, using social network analysis I investigate if interaction on Stack Overflow is organised by gender. Results show that sharing and recognising technical knowledge is dictated by users’ gender, even when it is operationalised beyond a binary. I find that feminine users receive lower scores for their answers, despite exhibiting higher effort in their contributions. I also show that interaction on Stack Overflow is organised by gender. Specifically, that feminine users preferentially interact with other feminine users. The findings emphasise the central role of gender in shaping interaction in technical spaces, a necessity for participation in the masculine-dominated forum. I conclude the study with recommendations for inclusivity in online forums."
- [Know how your org works](https://copyconstruct.medium.com/know-how-your-org-works-or-how-to-become-a-more-effective-engineer-1a3287d1f58d): "Social media, blog posts and conferences amplify aspirational ideas. There’s nothing wrong with this in my opinion — it’s important to constantly keep pushing the envelope further, after all. Your organization, however, rewards what you *actually get done* that benefits the organization, which might be a very far cry from whatever might be de rigueur on social media. ... One of the *most effective* things you can do to be successful at your job is to understand how your organization works. ... Managers need to deal with these skills as a part of their job description. So do ICs at the very senior levels, but it’s never too early to start cultivating this knowledge. In fact, a core part of mentoring engineers needs to be schooling them in how the organization works, which will then enable them to build a successful track record of getting things done. *Shielding non-senior engineers from organizational politics not just stymies their growth but also hinders their visibility into the skills they’d eventually need to learn the hard way, skills for which there exists no easy playbook, even if some managers and senior ICs might take a more short-sighted view and see this as a way to help other engineers “maintain focus”.* The most important skill for any engineer to posses is the ability to learn quickly.

    * **Understand Implicit Hierarchies**: "Most organizations have a formal structure. This usually starts with a VP or a director at the top, down to individual teams. ... Most organizations ... also tend to have something of an informal structure, especially among the ICs. ... It’s important to be aware of this informal hierarchy, because as often as not, your work might end up being directly influenced by this hierarchy, irrespective of whatever your personal level and job title might be. ... Your efforts, as such, need to be multi-pronged:

        * Understand the implicit organizational hierarchy
        * Identify the people who wield undue influence and their way of thinking and general philosophies (by either talking to them, or other people in the organization, or researching their past work, reading any articles or blog posts they might have written, or talks they might have presented, etc.)
        * Identify how the aforementioned philosophies have been previously successfully applied to projects and teams they were on. Why were these efforts considered successful? What were the problems these philosophies solved, and what were the problems they didn’t solve (or exacerbated)?
        * How do you build credibility with them? Can you lean on your past work? Your subject matter expertise? Your previous track record? Is there someone they trust and respect who can vouch for you, for them to take a leap of faith and agree to do things “your” way?

    * **Cultures: Top-Down, Bottom-Up, and Both**: Irrespective of titles and hierarchies, most organizations also have a somewhat top-down or bottom-up culture (or a mix of both). A top-down culture is one where the most important decisions are made from the top down. The person making the final decision could be either a tech lead, sometimes a manager, or a director level executive. On such teams, a large part of your success boils down to “managing up”. On bottom-up teams, the challenge is to manage laterally (in addition to managing-up).

    * **Get comfortable with the "mess"**: You’re far likelier to encounter codebases that have “evolved” over time, with poor documentation, lots of outdated comments and often with little to no tests than you are to encounter ones which are perfectly documented, have well-tested public and internal APIs, and code which is perfectly obvious. You’re going to far more productive if you learn how to navigate such codebases successfully, which involves learning some of the following:

        * how to gather just the right amount of information to get on with your task
        * how not to get too caught up in the weeds unless required
        * how to read a lot of code at a fast clip and come away with a reasonably good mental model of what it’s trying to do
        * how to come up with hypothesis and use a variety of general purpose techniques and tools to validate the hypothesis
        * how to reproduce bugs quickly without elaborate local configurations and setups

        The same philosophy applies when working with sociotechnical systems like organizations: get comfortable with mess. You’re far likelier to encounter organizations comprising of teams and leaders of:
        
        * varying levels of skill and ability to deliver on their promises
        * varying (sometimes even opposing) incentives and reward structures
        * varying appetites for risk or change
        * varying philosophical views on software development and systems
        * varying levels of tolerance for failure
        * varying willingness to make investments (in people and projects) with a long-term view in mind

        Being successful in such organizations requires quickly learning the topology of the organization and charting pathways to navigate it.

    * **Look For Small (And Any) Wins**: To build credibility, you need to demonstrate some degree of impact early on, instead of waiting for months to get a lie of the land before you start getting anything done.

    * **Understand Org Constraints and Manage Your Expectations**: It’s important to mention that individual managers (much less ICs), can sometimes do only so much when it comes to solving some of the more entrenched organizational problems.

    You’re far more likelier to be one of those rare unicorn engineers who is a real force multiplier if you’re also:

    * good at solving pressing problems
    * relentlessly getting things done
    * successfully creating change than just endlessly talking about the need to do so

    Which, alas, requires understanding how your organization works."

[Plucky 1:1 Starter Pack](https://shop.beplucky.com/products/the-plucky-1-1-starter-pack) | [Plucky 1:1 Manager Pack](https://shop.beplucky.com/products/1-1-manager-pack): "Conversation cards" for those awkward moments of silence in a 1:1. Highly recommended.

[T-Shaped People and Academia](https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2022/t/): "... academia is doing a disservice to ‘T-shaped persons,’ i.e. persons combining deep expertise in one or more fields with an ability to collaborate across areas. T-shaped persons are often contrasted with I-shaped persons, commonly known as experts. Given the state of the art in the software industry, T-shaped people are a sought-for commodity: the current ‘framework du jour’ might be obsolete in a few years, but the horizontal bar of a T-shaped person ensures that they can also contribute to other aspects of a project, and quite likely will develop new vertical bars, i.e. new expertise over time."

#### 9 Questions for 1:1s
(by Claire Lew, CEO of [KnowYourCompany](http://knowyourteam.com))

1. "Are you afraid of anything at work?"
2. "Have you seen something recently and thought to yourself 'I wish we'd done that'?"
3. "Is there something we should measure in the company that we currently don't?"
4. "Is there any part of the company you wish you were able to interact with more?"
5. "Are there any benefits we don't offer that you'd like to see us offer?"
6. "Is there an area outside your current role where you feel you could be contributing?"
7. "Is there anyone at the company you wish you could apprentice under for a few weeks?"
8. "Have you seen someone here do great work that's gone unnoticed?"
9. "Are there things you don't know about the company that you feel you should know?"

#### Ashlee Clifton (Rocket Mortgage) uses these to open 1:1s with people.

* My personal Beliefs and expectations that carry into work - These are your personal ISMs.  List your beliefs and expectations so it is clear for your team members what you expect.

* My personal and work fears - List here what is always in the back of your mind.  Show them you are vulnerable you are not all sunshine and rainbows.

* Best Ways I learn - Let them know how you like to learn, receive feedback, etc.   This will help open the lines of communication and get you started on the right page.

* I am motivated by (Goals, Praise) - Let the person know what motivates you, so they can help.  How do you like to receive recognition?

* ["A Simple Framework for Software Engineering Management"](https://medium.com/swlh/a-simple-framework-for-software-engineering-management-f70b216540f2): Responsibilities (people management, delivery leadership, technical system ownership) in a 2-axis grid with priorities (issues, things that are OK, ideas/aspirations). "To sum up, we can look at software engineering management as a combination of three areas of responsibilities: *people management*, *delivery leadership*, and *technical system ownership*. Paying attention to all three responsibilities is important. However the amount of attention each responsibility should get depends on the team, the organisation, the product, and other factors. It also changes over time. Within each responsibility area we can identify issues, things that are okay, as well as ideas and aspirations. Things that are already okay only need to be acknowledged. Issues need to be prioritised and promptly resolved. Ideas and aspirations should be evaluated and, if deemed relevant, executed or put on the roadmap."

* ["5 Things High-Performing Teams Do Differently"](https://hbr.org/2021/10/5-things-high-performing-teams-do-differently)

    1. High-Performing Teams Are Not Afraid to Pick Up the Phone (communicate more frequently)
    2. High-Performing Teams Are More Strategic With Their Meetings (avoid poor meetings by requiring prework from participants; introduce an agenda; begin with a check-in that keeps team members apprised of one another's progress)
    3. High-Performing Teams Invest Time Bonding Over Non-Work Topics (high-performing team members are significantly more likely to spend time at the office discussing non-work matters with their colleagues (25% more) — topics that may extend to sports, books, and family)
    4. High-Performing Teams Give and Receive Appreciation More Frequently (within the best teams, appreciation doesn’t flow from the top down. It’s a cultural norm that’s observable in peer-to-peer interactions)
    5. High-Performing Teams Are More Authentic at Work (high-performing teams were significantly more likely to express positive emotions with their colleagues; interestingly, however, they were also more likely to express negative emotions at work. Why would expressing negative emotions at work yield more positive performance? It’s because the alternative to expressing negative emotions is suppressing them, and suppression is cognitively expensive. It involves expending valuable cognitive resources attempting to hide emotions from others, leaving less mental firepower for doing the work.)

* ["Are Emily and Greg More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination"](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873): "We perform a field experiment to measure racial discrimination in the labor market. We respond with fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perception of race, each resume is assigned either a very African American sounding name or a very White sounding name. The results show significant discrimination against African-American names: White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. We also find that race affects the benefits of a better resume. ***For White names, a higher quality resume elicits 30 percent more callbacks whereas for African Americans, it elicits a far smaller increase. Applicants living in better neighborhoods receive more callbacks but, interestingly, this effect does not differ by race.*** The amount of discrimination is uniform across occupations and industries. Federal contractors and employers who list Equal Opportunity Employer' in their ad discriminate as much as other employers. We find little evidence that our results are driven by employers inferring something other than race, such as social class, from the names. These results suggest that racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market."

* ["Does Stress Impact Technical Interviews?"](https://chrisparnin.me/pdf/stress_FSE_20.pdf): "Software engineering candidates commonly participate in whiteboard technical interviews as part of a hiring assessment. During these sessions, candidates write code while thinking-aloud as they work towards a solution, under the watchful eye of an interviewer. While technical interviews should allow for an unbiased and inclusive assessment of problem-solving ability, surprisingly, another possibility is that technical interviews are instead a procedure for identifying candidates who best handle and migrate stress solely caused by being examined by an interviewer (performance anxiety). To understand if coding interviews—as administered today—can induce stress that significantly hinders performance, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with 48 Computer Science students, comparing them in private and public whiteboard settings. We found that performance is reduced by more than half, by simply being watched by an interviewer. We also observed that stress and cognitive load were significantly higher in a traditional technical interview when compared with our private interview. Consequently, interviewers may be filtering out qualified candidates by confounding assessment of problem-solving ability with unnecessary stress. We propose interview modifications to make problem-solving assessment more equitable and inclusive, such as through private focus sessions and retrospective think-aloud, allowing companies to hire from a larger and diverse pool of talent."

* [A fractal of lies](https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/a-fractal-of-lies): Dr House was right: everybody lies. (More to the point, studies are often built off of interviews and interrogation, and people have a habit of telling interviewers not-entirely-truthful things for a variety of reasons.) "Whenever there is an advantage, or a power gradient, or a political agenda, or people just want to fuck with you for their own amusement, probably there are lies. And then people repeat those lies - sometimes purely innocently, sometimes adding their own lies on top."

* [Twitter thread: "Here are 12 things your manager may not be telling you, but I know for a fact will help you."](https://twitter.com/LBacaj/status/1478241311392108545):

    1. As a software engineer, you are not there to take requirements blindly. You are there to partner with your business and product partners. That means you have to earn an equal seat at the table on product decisions.
    2. Being smart or good at what you do does not give you the right to be a jerk. Empathy as an engineer is a superpower. Caring about those you work with will do more for your career than writing beautiful defect-free code.
    3. As someone in the code, every day, you will see things that others will never see. You will know what's possible; they'll guess what's possible. Some of the best product features are born because engineers found clever ways to solve something. Look out for those things.
    4. You are there to add value first. All the code you wrote will end up in the recycling bin of some computer if it does not add value directly or indirectly to the business. It doesn't matter how pretty your code is or how much you love it if it doesn't add value.
    5. Your code should follow this pattern:

        1. Make it work
        2. Make it fast
        3. Make it beautiful 
        
        Reminder: You won't have a chance to make it fast or beautiful if it doesn't add value.
    6. Build relationships with engineers in other teams and other companies. Learn about the problems they are solving. Learn different architecture and designs than the ones your team uses. You never know when their solutions will save you days of work.
    7. You don't need permission to add value. If you see something and know you can fix or improve it, do it. Nobody will ever say to you, "why did you add all that value? WTF is wrong with you!?" Every time I've done that unexpectedly, I've earned outsized rewards.
    8. 10x engineers do exist and so do .1x engineers too. If you think they don’t exist, that’s just because you haven’t worked with any of them yet. *(I disagree with this one immensely, and I despise the "that's just because you haven't worked with one yet" coda that essentially tries to abort any disagreement ahead of time.)*
    9. Just because you think someone shouldn’t be hired, that does not mean they aren’t a good engineer. It also does not mean they don’t have a strong work ethic. A strong work ethic is the most important thing, and it's nearly impossible to tease out in an interview.
    10. Advocate for junior engineers. My friend @VicVijayakumar reminded me that just because they don't have 10+ years of experience does not mean they won't be good. Without junior engineers on the team, no one will grow. Help others grow; you'll grow too.
    11. Have empathy for the people you interview. You could be in that situation. The set of things to know is large, even if you only ask basics. Plus, on a whiteboard, the other person is being judged. They have a lot to lose, maybe hundreds of thousands in income.
    12. Even though you work with computers, your career and future depend on people. Until AI runs things, people still run the world, and relationships matter a lot. Build relationships with people outside of engineering, listen to their problems. It will change your trajectory. *(AI won't run things; or, arguably, computers are already running things. It won't change much aside from scope and a gently-increasing distance from the manufacturing cycle. But humans will never give up some level of control, we're too egotistical for that.)*

## Blog posts

These are some notes from insightful blog posts on what it takes to be an effective tech lead.

### [Effective Technical Leadership](https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/effective-technical-leadership-b193a544e771)

What makes a badass TL is broken down into three A's: attributes, activities and actions.

#### Attributes

Over time, you should always be increasing three attributes: Knowledge, Speed, and Awareness.

* Knowledge: If work is completed, but waiting to be reviewed, then you should almost always drop your own work and help move it forward.
* Speed: You should strive to be ultra-responsive and capable of making instant decisions, always kicking the ball forward.
* Awareness: You should be able to keep the current state of the entire project in your head at all times. Otherwise, you cannot be aware of potentially imminent blockers.

#### Activities

The two most important things that a tech lead can do also happen to be exact polar opposites: block and unblock.

* Block: The tech lead needs to be alert and aware to what is going on in the project, always ready to jump in and block bad decisions before they are made, typically armed with a better solution. Blocking should not stop progress, it course corrects so things can keep moving. Think harness, not safety net.
* Unblock: If someone has a question, you should be able to either give an answer or bring in the right person to field it.
* Redirect: Mentally build an expert index so you always know where to find an answer. Proactively adding the right individuals to any thread or code review can help increase the overall quality of the work.
* Decide: The faster you can reach a decision, the quicker others can act on it. When you do listen to your instincts, make sure that you're making a robust decision that can stand the test of time. When given a set of options, reduce the number to 2, see if there is a best choice based on experience or data. If not, redirect to someone better suited, or block the decision from being made or unblock it by going with your instinct.
* Show: Have the respect and trust of your team, which is best accomplished by demonstrating that you know your stuff.

#### Actions

There is a long assorted list. Here is an attempt to put its items into buckets:

* Management responsibilities "outward": Say "no" often to new or unnecessary features, vet the product's privacy and security concerns, work with other engineering teams especially on dependencies, etc.
* Management responsibilities "inward": Create and maintain launch and testing and release plans, shield engineers from management, setup team fix-its and hackathons and bug scrubs, escalate blocking issues as necessary, and load-balance work among the team, etc.
* Other management responsibilities: Help create and stack rank project priorities, create target milestone dates and correct and refine them as needed, etc.
* Best technical practices: Define best practices for issue tracking, maintain on-call and onduty processes, and ensure tests are being written for core functionality, etc.
* Team growth: Recruit engineers, review code in detail and give useful feedback, read and write and give feedback on design documents, help onboard, etc.
* Technical action: Identify technical debt, generate new ideas and elegant solutions, debug difficult production issues, write the right code at the right times, etc.


### [5 Tips for Being an Effective Tech Lead](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/5-tips-being-effective-tech-lead)

#### Learn to Delegate

* When you take on the harder problems, it also misses an opportunities for other developers to grow and problem solve.
* For problems when your experience and knowledge are important, find a way to delegate but still be involved. Kicking off a design session to discuss general approaches, or reviewing progress a regular basis.

#### Find Time to Code

* Being involved in the code helps you build respect with the rest of the team, and keeps your knowledge up to date and current with constraints, problems, and the "shape" of the codebase.

#### Visualise Your Architecture

* Have a visual representation of their system architecture on-hand and uses it to have discussions with developers.
* Host a whole-team whiteboard session. Focus on attributes that drive your architectural vision (scalability, performance, usability concerns, etc) and how they have shaped your architecture. Call out assumptions and the historical context.

#### Spend Time 1-on-1 With Team Members

* Anything that you can do to make each person on your team better makes the overall team better.
* Understand the backgrounds, strengths, interests and goals of the team members. Align their tasks with their responses.
* Connect developers with opportunities for them to grow.

#### Learn to Speak the Language of the Business

* To communicate technical concepts to non-technical people, find the terms that business people use and find ways to explain tasks in those terms.


### [What It Takes to Be a Great Technical Lead](http://elegantcode.com/2008/12/03/what-it-takes-to-be-a-great-technical-lead/)

* Possess strong technical skills. You’re also responsible for fixing technical issues that your teammates can't solve. If you can't fix something yourself, find an acceptable workaround.
* Teach your teammates. If there are some core principles or practices that you want them to apply to their work, you must invest time to promote that understanding.
* Trust your teammates. If you trust a teammate, that developer will respond with improved output. The quality may not be ideal, but the developer will show more effort.
* Stimulate self-organization. Do not simply assign tasks to your teammates, but organize planning meetings where members can choose their tasks. But promote a balance in the assigned tasks.
* Don't keep the coolest technical tasks for yourself. Give your teammates the opportunities to work on such tasks. This raises morale, trust, and skill.
* Try to prevent overtime as much as possible. If in a situation where the team must put in some overtime, don't tell your teammates they have to do it; instead ask them if they want to do it. Also do not go home early while your teammates are still working.
* Remember that you are responsible for the final result. Never put the blame of something wrong on one of your teammates.
* Give credit where credit is due. Give credit where it is due, and make sure everyone else knows about it too, especially management. Never take credit for the work of a teammate.
* Realize that your teammates are not your developers. Having a leadership role does not mean that you can boss around your teammates. This destroys morale.

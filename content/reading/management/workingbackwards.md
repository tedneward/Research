# Chapter 1: Building Blocks

### Leadership Principles and Mechanisms

1. **Customer Obsession.** Leaders start with th customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
2. **Ownership.** Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say, "That's not my job."
3. **Invent and Simplify.** Leaders expet and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally awware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
4. **Are Right, A Lot.** Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspective and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
5. **Learn and Be Curious.** Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
6. **Hire and Develop the Best.** Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
7. **Insist on the Highest Standards.** Leaders have relentlessly high standards--many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to delivery high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
8. **Think Big.** Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
9. **Bias for Action.** Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.
10. **Frugality.** Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.
11. **Earn Trust.** Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team's body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
12. **Dive Deep.** Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them.
13. **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit.** Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting.Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
14. **Deliver Results.** Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

### Annual Planning: OP1 and OP2
Autonomous, single-threaded teams keep the company nimble, moving quickly with a minimum of external friction, but their autonomy must be paired with precise goal-setting to align each team's independent plans with the company's overarching goals. Planning for the calendar year beings in the summer, a painstaking process that requires four to eight weeks of intensive work.

The S-Team begins by creating a set of high-level expectations or objectives for the entire company. Once these high-level expectations are established, each group begins work on its own more granular operating plan (OP1) which sets out the individual group's "bottom up" proposal. Through the narrative process (Chap 4), evaluate about ten times as much information as the typical company does in a similar time frame. The main components of an OP1 narrative are:

* Assessment of past performance, including goals achieved, goals missed, and lessons learned
* Key initiatives for the following year
* A detailed income statement
* Requests (and justifications) for resources, which may include things like new hires, marketing spend, equipment, and other fixed assets
  
Each group works in partnership with its finance and HR counterparts to create their detailed plan, whic is then presented to a panel of leaders whose level (director, VP, S-Team) depends on the size, impact, or strategic importance of the group. The panel then reconciles any gaps between the bottom-up proposal and the top-down goals the group has been asked to meet, and iterate.

The OP1 process runs through the fall and completed before fourth-quarter. In January, OP1 is adjusted as necessary to reflect the fourth-quarter results, as well as to udpate the trajectory. This shorter process is called OP2, and it generates the plan of record for the calendar year.

# Chapter 2: Hiring

### Bar Raiser Process
(The need for a rigorous interview process. Bezos: "We want missionaries, not mercenaries.")

(What's wrong with a conventional approach: interviewers who lack a rigorous model for their role in the hiring process leave themselves open to a range of pitfalls; even the smartest interviewer can wander off-script and ask questions that lack a clear objective, leading to answers that reveal nothing about a candidate's likely job performance. Interviewer feedback is often communicated to the broader team with insufficient clarity and unintentional bias. Focusing on candidate qualities that don't reliably predict performance can also skew decisions in the wrong direction. Unstructured hiring decision meetings can give rise to groupthink, confirmation bias, and other cognitive traps that feel right at the time but produce poor decisions.)

### The Bar Raiser Solution
The name of both a larger process and the group of individuals (Bar Raisers) central to that process. They get special training in the process. One participates in every interview loop. Cannot be the hiring manager or a recruiter; can veto any hire and override the hiring manager. By raising the bar with each new hire, the team would get progressively stronger and produce increasingly powerful results.

Eight steps in the hiring process:
* Job Description: specific and focused.
* Resume Review: if the candidates are off-target, the JD probably needs work.
* Phone Screen: have a rubric ahead of time; solicit examples of the candidate's past behavior; focus on a subset of the Amazon Leadership Principles. Decide on bringing the candidate in for an interview; if on the fence, the answer is no. One in four is a reasonable success rate at this stage.
* In-House Interview: 5 - 7 hours to complete, involving expensive people, so must be carefully planned, prepared, and executed.
* Written Feedback
* Debrief/Hiring Meeting
* Reference Check
* Offer Through Onboarding
  
Track and report on the volume and rate at which candidates pass through the funnel and use this data to make process changes as well as to coach and train recruiters and hiring managers.

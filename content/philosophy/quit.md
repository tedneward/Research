# Prologue: The Gaffed Scale
Muhammad Ali: GOAT, and yet didn't know when to quit

**Grid vs Quit** We view grit and quit as opposing forces. While grit is a virtue, quit is a vice. Some goals are just not reachable, no matter how hard you continue. We ought not to confuse hindsight with foresight, which is what these aphorisms do. *(Survivor bias)* Success does not lie in sticking to things; it lies in picking the right thing to stick to and quitting the rest.

**Wrapped in Euphemism.** Lindsey Vonn: quit, but then said "I'm not giving up! I'm just starting a new chapter." The idea of quitting is such a bitter pill to swallow that we have to take it with a spoonful of sugar, or in this case, a spoonful of euphemism, the most famous of which is "pivot." We ought to stop thinking that we need to wrap the idea of quitting in bubble wrap. When it comes to quitting, the scale is gaffed (butcher's thumb on the scale to cheat customers).

**Science Says.** The book *Grit* is interpreted to mean "Never quit" but that's misinterpretation. She has herself written about the importance of trying lots of things (which requires that you quit lots of other things) to find the thing you want to stick with. There is a rich universe of science studying the human tendency to persevere *too long*, particularly in the face of bad news. Sunk cost, status quo bias, loss aversion, escalation of commitment, and so on. Kahneman's and Thaler's work. Science is telling us every day, we tend to stick to things too long in the face of signals that we ought to quit.

# Section I: The Case for Quitting

## Ch 1: The Opposite of a Great Virtue is Also a Great Virtue
**The Invisible Men at the Top of the World.** Mt Everest: a place where people really should learn to quit sooner. Three climbers: Dr Stuart Hutchison, Dr John Taske, Lou Kasischke. Part of a commercial guided expedition of Everest. Expedition leader stressed importance of having strictly-observed turnaround times (return to camp if you've not yet reached your destination) for each day's climb up the mountain. (Eight times more people die on Everest on the way down than on the way up.) Turnaround times are there to prevent people from making poor decisions to keep going when they're in the shadow of the summit, building into a climbing plan three critical concepts:

1. persistence is not always a virtue
2. making a plan for when to quit should be done long before you are facing the quitting decision
3. the turnaround time is a reminder that the real goal in climbing Everst is not to reach the summit, but to return safely to the base of the mountain

*(Simple Rules!)*

Hutchison, Taske, Kasischke were part of one of three expeditions, making the climb too crowded. Trio got stuck, with expedition leader, behind a group of incompetent climbers. At 11:30am, Hutchison called a meeting, realized that turnaround time was 1pm, and they wouldn't make it. Turned around. Made it safely back to the camp. Rest of the group was well-documented (book *Into Thin Air*, documentary *Everest*, 2015 film *Everest*), expedition leader Hall (who set the turnaround time!) and four others who reached the summit died on various parts of their descent back. But we don't know the Hutchison/Taske/Kasischke trio, because we tend to think about only one side of the human response to adversity (the ones who go for it). Even in this life-or-death situation, where quitting is the right decision, we don't remember the quitters at all.

**Quitting is a Decision-Making Tool.** Grit and quit are two sides of the same exact decision; you can't decide one thing without deciding the other. Grit is what gets you up the mountain, but quit is what tells you when to come down. ***"If I had to skill somebody up to get them to be a better decision-maker, quitting is the primary skill I would choose, because the option to quit is what allows you to react to a changing landscape."*** Any decision is made under some degree of uncertainty, stemming from two sources:

1. The world is stochastic: luck makes it difficult to predict exactly how things will turn out, at least in the short run. We operate not with certainties but with probabilities.
2. When we make decisions, we don't have all the facts.

When you take all these aspects of uncertainty together, it makes decision-making hard. But, after you've set out on a particular course of action, ***new information will reveal itself to you***. Feedback. Quitting is the tool that allows you to keep from being paralyzed by uncertainty or stuck forever in every decision you make. Quitting is what allows companies to maximize speed, experimentation, and effectiveness in highly uncertain environments.

Richard Pryor--greatest comedian ever--would routinely do shows at the Comedy Store on Sunset Strip with nothing prepared beyond "a couple of ideas" or "one or two jokes at the most" and bomb. The next night, he'd drop everything that didn't work--nearly the whole set--and expand on whatever got a titter. At the end of 30 days, he had 40 minutes of incredible material. *(OODA! He had a freakin 24-hour OODA loop!)*

**The Siren Song of Certainty.** Uncertainty is an impediment to making good decisions about quitting. Only one choice--the choice to persevere--lets you (eventually) find out the answer. The desire for certainty is the siren song calling us to persevere, because perseverance is the only path to avoiding the ambiguity of not knowing how it all turned out.

**The Super Bowl is a Corporate Graveyard.** The list of Super Bowl advertisers in Tom Brady's football career who've failed is long and impressive: AOL, Blockbuster, Circuit City, CompUSA, Gateway, Radio Shack, Sears. Super Bowl ads are big and expensive--if you could afford one, you were a big, successful company. Each couldn't maintain their success--the scale must be gaffed against quitting not just for individuals but for businesses as well. ***The road to sustained profitability for a business is not only about sticking to a strategy or business model, it is also about surveying and reacting to the changing landscape.***

**"Know When to Hold 'Em, Know When to Fold 'Em": But Mostly, Fold 'Em.** Three of the four things from Kenny Rogers' lyric are about quitting. When it comes to cutting your losses at the poker table, he "got it". Optimal quitting might be the most important skill separating great poker players from amateurs. Top poker players are know when to fold 'em: Pros play a mere 15% to 25% of the two-card starting combinations they are dealt in Texas Hold 'Em. Amateurs stick with over half. ***To be good at the game you ahve to learn to live with the idea that you folded some hands that might've won.*** Quitting a game is a decision fraught with uncertainty because it is never clear exactly why you are losing--you could be playing really well but losing because of an unlucky run of cards. In other words, if you want to glame your losses on luck and keep playing, you can always find a way to do that. Quitting a game when you're losing is the only way to guarantee you won't get those chips back in that game, which makes quitting when you are losing difficult. *(Again, here's the power of a stopping rule: Take the emotion and ego out of the decision by creating the stopping rule before it becomes an issue.)*

**Summary:**

* We tend to celebrate people who respond to adversity by soldiering on. The quitters, in comparison, are invisible.
* If we don't notice the decision-making of the quitters, it's hard to learn from them.
* Quitting a course of actio is sometimes the best way to win in the long run, whether you're cutting your losses at the poker table or getting to climb another day.
* Quit and grit are two sides of the exact same decision.
* Decision-making in the real world requires action without complete information. Quitting is the tool that allows us to react to new information that is revealed *after* we make a decision.
* Sticking with a course of action is the only way to find out for sure how it will turn out. Quitting requires being okday with not knowing what might have been.
* Having the option to quit helps you to explore more, learn more, and ultimately find the right things to stick with.

## Ch 2: Quitting on Time Usually Feels Like Quitting Too Early

In 2002 Stuart Butterfield built *Game Neverending*, a cooperative game, and in 2004 it failed due to lack of funding in post-dot-com-crash environment. They salvaged one feature, an inventory of objects the players accumulated, represented by a shoebox of photos, which became Flickr, which within a year they sold to Yahoo for $25m. Butterfield left Yahoo in 2008 and created a new game, *Glitch*, secured a bunch of funding (due to Flickr's rep) and released it in 2011; it looked amazing, and by Nov 2012, it had a devoted following of 5,000 users playing 20+ hrs/week. Problem: paid users were less than 5% of the user base, the rest having done the free sign-up; over 95% of new users played *Glitch* for less than seven minutes and never returned. Made a major PR push, yet after a particularly good push, Nov 12, Butterfield sent an email to investors: "I woke up this morning with the dead certainty that Glitch was over." He was able to peek into the future, and saw that in the range of possible outcomes, the probability was too high that the game would end up being a money pit. The math of the conversion rate just didn't work. "I think I knew this six weeks ago and I mistook denial for prudence (in the sense of making sure that we didn't give up too early). But there are just too many things in the 'against' column."  This freed him and the company to work on a different product: the "Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge", aka Slack.

**Quit While You Still Have a Choice.** ***Quitting on time wil usually feel like quitting too early.*** Making good decisions about quitting requires mental time travel since the worst time to make a decision is when you're in it. That's when you are in the present, facing down the decision whether or not to cut your losses, unable to see past what is happening right now. When we do think about the future, we are often considering our hopes, our goals, our ambitions, and that optimism means that too often we allow a disastrous future to hurtle toward us, noticing it only as it's arriving on our doorstep. There is a well-known heuristic in management consulting that "the right time to fire someone is the first time it crosses your mind". But since this is a decision made under uncertainty, we tend to persist too long.

**Thinking in Expected Value.** To get the stick-or-quit decision right, you need to make an educated guess at the probability that things will go your way and the probability that things will go against you in order to figure out if the good stuff will occur enough of the time to warrant continuing on the same path. You need to think in Expected Value (EV). EV helps you answer two questions:

1. it tells you whether any option you are considering is going to be, on balance, positive or negative for you in the long run.
2. it allows you to compare different options to figure out which is the better choice, where "better choice" is the one that carries the highest expected value.

To determine the EV for any course of action, you start with identifying the range of reasonably possible outcomes, each of which will have some probability of occurring. If you multiply the probability of the outcome (p) with the outcome's good-or-bad (o), and add that all together, you get the EV. Example: fair coin flip (.5 heads, .5 tails) where heads = +$100, tails = -$50. Heads `p * o` is +$100 * .5 = +$50, Tails `p * o` is -$50 * .5 = -$25, EV is (+$50 + -$25), or +$25, or a positive EV. Example 2: Unfair coin flip, heads +$50 at p 0.9 (+$45) vs tails -$100 at p 0.1 (-$10), EV is +$35. Example 3: heads +$100,000 at p 0.01 (+$1,000), tails -$100 at p 0.99 (-$99), EV = +$901. *(All of this assumes we get 100 coin flips, though--if it's only one flip, then the decision-making changes here somewhat, I would think? I think Duke makes a subtle allowance for this: "Of course, that's a much riskier bet than the other two bets. Managing risk is the subject of many other books, but not this one.")*

Next, compare the EV for each option you might be considering. "If I were to switch and do something else, would that have a higher EV than the thing I'm currently doing?" Winning poker players aren't thinking about trying to win a single hand, come what may--they know while any two cards can win, only some hands can win enough of the time to make them worth pursuing. They are making decisions based on whether playing or folding will have the greater EV.

**Quitting Decisions are Expected-Value Decisions.** 2001: Duke gets an email from a reader who wanted help working through a decision about whether to quit her job. Duke asks, "A year from now, if you stay, what's the probability that you're going to be unhappy at the end of that year?" 100%. "A year from now, if you take the new job, what's the probability that you're going to be unhappy?" "Not sure" "Is it 100%?" "Definitely not." Enlightenment. Duke reframed the question as an EV problem.

**Time Travelers from the Past.** Thinking in expected value is a kind of mental time travel, propelling yourself into the future to glimpse the range of possible outcomes and take some reasonable guess at how likely each of them is. As a means to becoming a better quitter, this works in both directions: You can get the benefit of listening to a message *from the past*. Adm William McRaven, one of the world's most respected figures on military strategy, US foreign policy, and counterterrorism ops, is a longtime student of military history: "Probably three quarters of the books behind me (on his wall of bookshelves) are history books about battles that went well and battles that went wrong." When you are making a decision about whether to quit, you need to listen to those people from the past who are giving you important advice, whether its others or yourself.

**Flipping Coins.** 2013: Steven Levitt (author, *Freakonomics*) put up a website inviting visotrs to flip a virtual coin to help them decide quit-or-stick. They would register what they were stuggling with, among a variety of types of decisions, like "Should I quit my job or stay?" or "Should I leave my relationship?" or "Should I stay in college?". The site would assign one side of the decision to Heads, the other to Tails, and then randomly flip the coin. 20,000 people over the course of a year did this. Obviously, these people must have felt that the choice of quit-or-stick was so close, so 50-50, that flipping a coin to help them decide seemed like a reasonable option. Theoretically, they would be equally likely to be happier with either heads or tails, stick or quit. But this isn't what Levitt found. When he followed up with the coin flippers at 2 months and 6 months later, he discovered that for the big life decisions, people who quit were happier on average than people who stuck, whether they quit on their own or after the coin flip suggested quitting. ***While the decisions may have felt close to the people making them, they were actually not close at all. As judged by the participants' happiness, quitting was the clear winner.*** Because people were much happier when they quit what they considered a close decision, that shows that people are generally quitting too late. Levitt concluded, "The results of this paper suggest that people may be excessively caution when facing life-changing choices." Corollary: ***When people quit on time, it will usually feel like they are quitting too early, because it will be long before they experience the choice as a close call.***

**Jumping the Shark.** (*Happy Days* pop-culture reference.) We have an expectation that people ought to have seen in foresight what we can so easily see in hindsight. And when they don't, we can't believe how obtuse they are. That's the point of jumping the shark: It's mocking someone who doesn't quit on time, no matter that it's much harder to see the shark in foresight. But the sad thing is that as much as we make fun of people who quit too late, when someone does manage to quit on time, we mock them for quitting too early. That's the "quitting bind".

**The Quitting Bind.** Dave Chappelle quits *Chappelle's Show* in season 3, at the top of his game. Rumors swirled why. He quit because he could see two things: (1) he was unhappy in a future where he continued the show, and (2) he could see the shark: he was close to crossing the line between his audience laughing with him, and his audience laughing at him. Similar disappointment around Phoebe Waller-Bridge (2019) ending *Fleabag*, which in two seasons (2016, 2019) earned massive worldwide acclaim. Fans beg for more, despite Waller-Bridge's explanation that ending the series was consistent with the arc of the title character.

**Sunmmary:**

* Quitting on time usually feels like quitting too early.
* The hardest time to make a quitting decision is when you're in it.
* Our intuition is that quitting will slow down our progress. The reverse is actually true. If you walk away from something that is no longer worthwhile, that frees you up to switch to something that is more likely to help you achieve your goals--and you'll get there faster.
* When the time is objectively right to quit, nothing particularly dire will be happening right at that moment. Getting the timing right means looking into the future and seeing that the chances things will go your way are too slim.
* Thinking in expected value (EV) helps you figure out if the path you are on is worth sticking to. EV is not just about money. It can be measured in health, well-being, happiness, time, self-fulfillment, satisfaction in relationships, or anything else that affects you.
* If you feel like the choice between persevering and walking away is a close call, it's likely that quitting is the better choice.
* In hindsight, we can see when someone has waited too long to quit, and we tend ot be harsh in our judgment of those people. But when smoeone quits before it seems obvious to others, we mock them for quitting too early. That's the quitting bind.

## Ch 3: Should I Stay or Should I Go?

**Summary:**

* A key finding of prospect theory is *loss aversion*, the phenomenon whereby the emotional impact of a loss is greater than the corresponding impact of an equivalent gain.
* Loss aversion creates a preference for options associated with a lower chance of incurring a loss. It makes us risk averse.
* When we are in the gains, we have a tendency to quit too early in order to avoid the risk of giving those gains back. In other words, we like to quit while we're ahead.
* When we are in the losses, we become risk seekers. We want to keep going, hoping we can avoid ever having to realize the loss. Kahneman characterizes this as *sure-loss aversion*. In other words, we like to stick when we're behind.
* Quitting on time usually feels like quitting too early, and the *usually* part is *specifically when you're in the losses*.
* Retail investors show this pattern of quitting when they're ahead and sticking when they're behind.
* Even expert investors don't get their quitting decisions just right. They outperform on their buying decisions but underperform on their selling decisions.
* We naturally track and get feedback on the things we are doing. But once we quit something, we also quit keeping track of that course of action. This creates a problem with getting high-quality feedback, which in turn makes it hard to hone our quitting skills.

# Interlude I: Quitting When the World is Watching
2016: Alex Honnold prepares to free-solo-climb El Cap and a group of friends document the climb (which is them risking their lives, too). He quits. Comes back next June, crew reassembles, he successfully summits, free solo, and the documentary *Free Solo* is released in 2018, winning the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. Had he not quit, he could easily have died, and the pressure was to stick.

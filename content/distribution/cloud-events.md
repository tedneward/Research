summary=A common information model for events.
~~~~~~

It defines what an event is and what a set of common attributes are that make the event useful in many contexts. CloudEvents then defines formats (JSON, Avro, AMQP, Protbuf, XML) in which a CloudEvent can be expressed and protocol bindings for how CloudEvents can be transported (HTTP, AMQP, MQTT, Kafka).

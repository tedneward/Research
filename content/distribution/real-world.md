While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build real applications with it. That's why we, with the help of open source experts, design and serve as exemplary real world applications for each framework.

See how _the exact same_ Medium.com clone is built using different [frontends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=frontend) and [backends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=backend). Yes, you can mix and match them, because **they all adhere to the same [API spec](https://docs.realworld.show/specifications/backend/introduction)**

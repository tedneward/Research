[Protocol Guide](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/): How Scuttlebutt peers find and talk to each other. Scuttlebutt is a protocol for building decentralized applications that work well offline and that no one person can control. Because there is no central server, Scuttlebutt clients connect to their peers to exchange information. This guide describes the protocols used to communicate within the Scuttlebutt network.

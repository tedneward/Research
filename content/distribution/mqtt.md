"MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. For example, it has been used in sensors communicating to a broker via satellite link, over occasional dial-up connections with healthcare providers, and in a range of home automation and small device scenarios. It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size, low power usage, minimised data packets, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers."

From Clemens Vasters: MQTT (formerly "MQ Telemetry Transport") is a lightweight pubsub protocol that was initially developed by IBM as a companion protocol to their MQ product. IBM then submitted it for standardization to OASIS, where the input specification was turned into version 3.1.1. and the TC then developed version 5.0 from there, with significant input from Microsoft.

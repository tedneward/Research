The primary functions of SourceHub are:

* ACP Module: A decentralized authorization engine, inspired in part by Google Zanzibar's Relational Based Access Control (RelBAC)
* Bulletin Module: A trust minimized network broadcast hub. Used both for DefraDBs Document Anchoring and Orbis's Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to optimize its network communication to initialize and maintain the Distributed Key Generation (DKG)
* Developer-Lock Tier Module: A SaaS inspired pricing module to streamline DevEx around tokenomics, abstract transaction gas, and simplify user wallet experience. Similar to Account Abstraction systems, but native to our protocol.

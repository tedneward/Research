summary=The next generation of decentralized networking technology.
~~~~~~

Spritely builds on our experience co-authoring ActivityPub, the largest decentralized social network on the web to date, while applying powerful ideas from object capability security research.

[Goblins](https://spritely.institute/goblins/): Distributed, transactional programming [Whitepaper](https://spritely.institute/static/papers/spritely-core.html)  Provides an intuitive security model, automatic local transactions for locally synchronous operations, and an easy to use and efficient asynchronous programming interface for encapsulated objects which can live anywhere on the network. 

Uses [Hoot](/languages/lisp/guile), the Guile Scheme-to-WebAssembly compiler.

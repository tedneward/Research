RDP works on the client-server model, where an RDP client is installed on a local machine, and an RDP server is installed on the remote server. RDP is widely used for Windows remote connections, but you can also access and interact with the graphical user interface of a remote Linux server by using a tool like xrdp, an open-source implementation of the RDP server.

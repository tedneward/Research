ActiveJ is a set of orthogonal minimalist libraries, with as few dependencies as possible with respect to each other, that can be used together or separately. This was the design goal - not to develop yet another framework that would force the user to use it on an all-or-nothing basis, but instead to give the user as much freedom as possible in terms of choosing library components.

ActiveJ consists of a range of libraries, ranging from dependency injection and high-performance asynchronous I/O (inspired by Node.js) to application servers and big data solutions. It is designed to be self-sufficient (with no third-party dependencies), simple, lightweight, and provide competitive performance.

You can utilize ActiveJ to build scalable web applications, distributed systems, and deploy it for high-load data processing.

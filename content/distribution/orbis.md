Orbis is a decentralized Secrets Management engine powered by Threshold-Proxy ReEncryption and Multi-Party Computation to enable trustless system to manage and share application and user secrets. Application and user secrets can be anything from encryption keys, API tokens, to general small sized messages. This is comparable to other Secrets Management systems like Hashicorp Vault but without a single centralized entity.

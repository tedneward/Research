summary=Efficient reliable UDP unicast, UDP multicast, and IPC message transport.
~~~~~~

"Java and C++ clients are available in this repository, and a .NET client is available from a 3rd party. All three clients can exchange messages across machines, or on the same machine via IPC, very efficiently. Message streams can be recorded by the Archive module to persistent storage for later, or real-time, replay. Performance is the key focus. Aeron is designed to be the highest throughput with the lowest and most predictable latency of any messaging system. Aeron integrates with Simple Binary Encoding (SBE) for the best possible performance in message encoding and decoding. Many of the data structures used in the creation of Aeron have been factored out to the Agrona project."

Usually Remmina is included in your distribution, or in an external repository you can add. (Ubuntu PPA looking for maintainer; may not be easy to install on Ubuntu?) **Debian**: 11 Bullseye (stable), Buster (oldstable), and Sid (unstable): Remmina is in the official stable, testing and unstable repositories.

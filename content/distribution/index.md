~~~~~~

Distributed systems are the means by which programs on one machine communicate with another. Differ from architectures in that while an architecture may have a distributed system at its center, it's not a requirement, and while distributed systems may incorporate an architecture as part of their implementation, that architecture usually isn't imposed on the user of the distributed system. Includes networking topics, for example.

title=Project Tye
tags=distribution, architecture, containers, clr
summary=An experimental developer tool that makes developing, testing, and deploying microservices and distributed applications easier.
~~~~~~

Project Tye includes a local orchestrator to make developing microservices easier and the ability to deploy microservices to Kubernetes with minimal configuration. Tye can:

* Simplify microservices development by making it easy to:
    * Run many services with one command
    * Use dependencies in containers
    * Discover addresses of other services using simple conventions
* Deploy .NET applications to Kubernetes by:
    * Automatically containerizing .NET applications
    * Generating Kubernetes manifests with minimal knowledge or configuration
    * Using the same conventions as development to keep it consistent

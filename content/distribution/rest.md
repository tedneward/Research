[Richardson Maturity Model](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html): a model of restful maturity that was developed by Leonard Richardson and explained at a QCon talk.

* Level 0
* Level 1 - Resources
* Level 2 - HTTP Verbs
* Level 3 - Hypermedia Controls

9. REST Basics - HTTP requests

Klotho - a CLI tool that transforms plain code into cloud native code. Klotho allows you to quickly and reliably add cloud functionality to your application with minimal modification to your code. In most cases, this is just a handful of klotho annotations.

It adds 3 main in-code cloud capabilities:

* expose web APIs to the Internet
* persist multi-modal data into different types of databases
* static_unit package static assets and upload into a CDN for distribution

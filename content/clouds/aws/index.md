## Messaging
AWS has a fleet of messaging services which reflects very similar architectural considerations as the Azure services.

* [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/en/sqs/) corresponds to Azure Storage Queues and Service Bus Queues (FIFO)
* [Amazon MQ](https://aws.amazon.com/en/amazon-mq) corresponds to Azure Service Bus, albeit at far smaller scale and less managed
* [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/en/kinesis/) corresponds to Azure Event Hubs
* [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/de/eventbridge/) corresponds to Azure Event Grid
* [Amazon IoT Core](https://aws.amazon.com/en/iot-core/) corresponds to Azure IoT Hub.

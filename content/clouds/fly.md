Looks like a Heroku-like competitor.

## "Speed run" getting started
For many languages and frameworks, you can deploy your app from zero, with the following three steps.

* Install `flyctl` - you'll need it.
* Create an account with `fly auth signup` or login with `fly auth login`.
* Run `fly launch` from inside your project source directory - create, configure, and deploy a new application.

Supports Crystal Deno Django Elixir Go Node Laravel Python Rails RedwoodJS Remix NuxtJS NextJS Ruby Static Website apps. You're not limited to these kinds of projects, though! fly launch also knows what to do with a Dockerfile, so you can use the tech you love.

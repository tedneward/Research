* Installable via pip
* pyproject.toml support
* Python 3.13 compatibility
* Drop-in parity with Flake8, isort, and Black
* Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files

* First-party editor integrations for VS Code and more
* Monorepo-friendly, with hierarchical and cascading configuration

Most who use BookStack enjoy its intuitive philosophy of a shelf being a generic subject or category, a book being a specific part of that shelf, and chapters within the book containing the most specific information.

Pros

* Lots of people consider BookStack the "gold standard" of wikis
* Divide notes into logical structure, which may not be applicable to all notes.
* Example usage: Shelf for servers, book for hardware, and chapters for specific servers.

Cons

* Could be spending a lot of time figuring out the best way for information to fit this structure.
* By default allowable upload file sizes are quite small. Instructions on how to modify this can be found in the documentation.

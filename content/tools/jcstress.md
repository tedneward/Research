In order to understand jcstress tests and maybe write your own, it might be useful to work through the jcstress-samples. The samples come in three groups:

* APISample target to explain the jcstress API;
* JMMSample target to explain the basics of Java Memory Model;
* ConcurrencySample show the interesting concurrent behaviors of standard library.

Maigret collects a dossier on a person by username only, checking for accounts on a huge number of sites and gathering all the available information from web pages. No API keys are required. Maigret is an easy-to-use and powerful fork of Sherlock.

Currently supports more than 3000 sites (full list), search is launched against 500 popular sites in descending order of popularity by default. Also supported checking Tor sites, I2P sites, and domains (via DNS resolving).

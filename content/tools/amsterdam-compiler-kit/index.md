title=Amsterdam Compiler Kit
tags=tool, languages, native
summary=A cross-platform compiler and toolchain suite that is small, portable, extremely fast, and extremely flexible. It targets a number of low-end machines including the Z80, 8086 and 80386, but there are many other code generators available. It supports several languages, including ANSI C, Pascal and Modula-2, and contains integrated runtime libraries including a libc. The toolchain is mainly known as being the default toolchain for Minix 1 and 2.

## Scheduling alternatives (to [Calendly](https://calendly.com/))

* [Calendso](https://cal.com/): [Source](https://github.com/calendso/calendso)
* [Cal.com](https://cal.com/) has a lot of potential to make a lot of people’s lives easier; it’s not only a useful tool, but it also appears to be fairly modern and offers a real alternative to the dance of trying to book a meeting. That means that it is by no means embarrassing to use when you’re trying to set up a meeting. But I’m not recommending it because, at least at this time, the process of actually installing it was a lot harder than I was expecting. I only got it working after this post published.
* If you’re a [NextCloud](https://midrange.tedium.co/issues/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-diy/) user, there’s a decent [appointment app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/appointments) that you can add to the application that covers most of Calendly’s basic use cases. Granted, it’s nowhere near as good as Calendly and doesn’t seamlessly integrate into Zoom, but unlike Cal.com, you can install it without ripping out your hair.

## Graphics and animation

* [Arteater](https://www.eatmy.art/): Create hand-drawn GIFs on paper, upload to transform
* [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)

---

## Site Analytics

* Google Analytics
* [Umami](https://app.umami.is/share/8rmHaheU/umami.is): Umami’s hosted cloud service is not quite ready for mainstream use yet, giving its competitor the edge for now. But watch this space.
* [Matomo](https://matomo.org/): only a little colder than the alternatives, and not by much. It’s still quite good. Its interface, which can be viewed in demo form here, is more like Google Analytics than the alternatives, but in a way that actually kind of makes sense.
* [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) strikes the perfect balance in terms of cost and usability. The company makes an open-source version that is quite good, but also offers a paid version that costs enough that you know you’re the customer, not the product. Easy to set up and friendly to use.

## Email Newsletter tools

* [Keila](https://www.keila.io/), a very-polished looking email sender that will fit many users’ needs, but its emphasis on a single flexible template makes it difficult to recommend for power users. (They are working on it, however—and the team seemed responsive to feedback.) Sendportal also has potential, but the fact it hasn’t been updated in more than a year gives us pause.
* [Mailtrain](https://github.com/Mailtrain-org/mailtrain) has most of the features one might expect out of an email-sending tool, including power-user features like support for MJML, but its user interface can feel imposing to new users. 
* A less-imposing but still-complex alternative is [Mautic](https://www.mautic.org/).
* [Listmonk](https://listmonk.app/) has a clean interface and lightweight feature set. It lacks some bells and whistles that some users might expect, like on-the-fly segmentation, but it’s closer to being a daily driver than any other tool in this category.
* Hosting something through your CMS is not a bad idea. [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), while not anywhere near as full-featured as the other tools mentioned for email use cases, strikes a good balance for the average creator.

---

## No-code Automation

* [Automatisch](https://automatisch.io/) is the closest thing to a direct open-source variant of Zapier at this time, as its design carries the spirit of the paid tool’s interface, but it is brand new, having just launched only in November, and doesn’t have many apps. It feels like one to watch, though. Unlike some of the other options, it falls under a traditional AGPL license, however. I had no trouble installing this locally.
* [N8n](https://n8n.io/) has the right number of apps, a larger community, and is much more mature than many of its competitors, but its less-intuitive design is potentially a turnoff. (Despite being free to self-host via a community option, it also does not have an open-source license.) It can be run inside a desktop application, though, which is a plus.
* [ActivePieces](https://www.activepieces.com/) seems to have the right momentum to get things going in a good direction; it also has a reasonably priced cloud option, and while it is also still new, it has a lot of potential and a quickly growing app list. (It, too, doesn’t use a pure GPL-style license, however. Another responsive-to-feedback team, however.)
* If your goal is just automating some basic tasks, the browser extension [Automa](https://www.automa.site/) also has a lot of potential.
* [Flowpipe: A workflow engine for DevOps scripters](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3712125/flowpipe-a-workflow-engine-for-devops-scripters.html): Uses HCL for configuration/definition

UMLet is a UML tool aimed at providing a fast way of creating UML diagrams. UML elements are modified using text input instead of pop-up dialogs. Elements can be modified and used as templates; this way, users can easily tailor UMLet to their modeling needs. UMLet supports a variety of UML diagram types: class diagrams, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, deployment diagrams, activity diagrams -- see some examples.

UMLet also allows users to create their own custom UML elements. An element's look can be modified at run-time by changing a few lines of Java code; UMLet then compiles the new element's code on the fly. Without leaving UMLet, users can thus create and add new element types to their diagrams.

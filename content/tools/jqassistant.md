It is centered around three main use cases:

-   Easily carry out [Software Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_analytics) to gain insights into your software systems
-   Continuously verify the correct implementation of targeted design and architecture using provided or user-defined rules to reach defined quality goals
-   Automatically enable [Living Documentation](https://medium.com/geekculture/living-documentation-brief-history-and-evolution-of-the-concept-4492fafb5d7) by generating documentation from the code and validating documentation against the implementation to avoid the documentation-code-gap and confusion

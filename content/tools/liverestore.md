A live bootable Linux environment packed with more than 300 utilities for unbootable Windows machines. It's under 1GB, so it's relatively lightweight on system resources and USB storage, allowing you to store more tools on the USB drive.

It shines where Windows tools struggle—like reading locked files or running raw disk diagnostics before attempting repairs. Unlike vendor recovery disks, which often wipe your system, SystemRescue preserves everything, allowing you to copy important files to external drives first.

It supports native access to Windows NTFS drives with the NTFS-3g driver and includes powerful utilities such as GParted for partition management, TestDisk for recovering deleted partitions, and ddrescue for cloning failing drives sector-by-sector right out of the box.

You can even launch Firefox to check for system and driver updates, or mount your PC to a network for backups. When your PC won't boot, is affected by ransomware, or is crashing randomly, SystemRescue is your go-to tool for data recovery and diagnosis. It’s versatile, fast, and doesn’t rely on the health of your Windows install, making it invaluable for serious recovery jobs via external storage.

"It prescribes approaches to content, architecture and form that emerge from a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users.

"Di√°taxis identifies four distinct needs, and four corresponding forms of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs."

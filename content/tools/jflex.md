summary=A lexical analyzer generator (also known as scanner generator) for Java, written in Java.
~~~~~~

"A lexical analyzer generator takes as input a specification with a set of regular expressions and corresponding actions. It generates a program (a lexer) that reads input, matches the input against the regular expressions in the spec file, and runs the corresponding action if a regular expression matched. Lexers usually are the first front-end step in compilers, matching keywords, comments, operators, etc, and generating an input token stream for parsers. Lexers can also be used for many other purposes.

"JFlex lexers are based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs). They are fast, without expensive backtracking.

"JFlex is designed to work together with the LALR parser generator CUP by Scott Hudson, and the Java modification of Berkeley Yacc BYacc/J by Bob Jamison. It can also be used together with other parser generators like ANTLR or as a standalone tool."

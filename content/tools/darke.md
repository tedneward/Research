Darke Files is a version control and file synchronization system. Its goal is to scale seamlessly between the two extremes:

* a full-featured version control system. It lets you work with branches and inspect and act on a rich version history. It works like version control systems programmers use today, for example Git.
* a file synchronization tool. It uploads your changed files to cloud storage so that you can forget it exists in the day-to-day operation. It works like cloud synchronization services everyone else uses, for example Dropbox or Google Drive.

Darke Files can scale between those two extremes in a single repository. This enables teams with a wide range of requirements for such a system to work on the same project.

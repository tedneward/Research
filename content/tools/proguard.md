ProGuardCORE is a free library to read, analyze, modify, and write Java class files. It is the core of the well-known shrinker, optimizer, and obfuscator ProGuard, the ProGuard Assembler and Disassembler, and the Kotlin Metadata Printer.

Typical applications:

* Read and write class files, including any Kotlin metadata.
* Search for instruction patterns.
* Create byte code instrumentation tools.
* Analyze code with abstract evaluation.
* Build static code analysis tools.
* Optimize and obfuscate, like ProGuard itself.

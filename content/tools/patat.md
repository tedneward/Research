Available via Homebrew (`brew install patat`).

patat (Presentations Atop The ANSI Terminal) is a feature-rich presentation tool that runs in the terminal.

* Understands most markdown extensions and many other input formats (rST, Org-mode...) by building on top of Pandoc.
* Evaluate code snippets and show the result.
* Syntax highlighting for nearly one hundred languages generated from Kate syntax files.
* Automatically reload your slides as you edit them.
* Display speaker notes in a second window or monitor.
* Incremental slide display.
* Experimental images support.
* Transition effects.
* Supports smart slide splitting.
* Auto advancing with configurable delay.
* Centering and re-wrapping text to terminal width with proper indentation.
* Theming support including 24-bit RGB.
* Highly portable as it only requires an ANSI terminal as opposed to something like ncurses.

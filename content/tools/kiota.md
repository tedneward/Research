The goal is to eliminate the need to take a dependency on a different API SDK for every API that you need to call. Kiota API clients provide a strongly typed experience with all the features you expect from a high quality API SDK, but without having to learn a new library for every HTTP API.

This library builds on top of the Microsoft.OpenAPI.NET library to ensure comprehensive support for APIs that use OpenAPI descriptions. One of the goals of the project is to provide the best code generator support possible for OpenAPI and JSON Schema features. The conceptual documentation describes how kiota works and the high level concepts, this readme documents how to get started with Kiota.

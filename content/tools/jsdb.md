~~~~~~

"JSDBÂ® is a JavaScript shell designed with network-centric programming in mind. It can be used as a database interface, XML processor, and internet-oriented scripting language. JSDB can do nearly any batch processing task that Visual Basic can do, and it has drivers to let you read and send email, query a MySQL database, and run regular expression searches, without having to learn a specific SQL syntax or install a bunch of ActiveX components. JSDB has everything you need to write a web server or database middleware, with a graphical debugger, itself written in JSDB."

[Shadow plugin](https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/introduction/): "Shadow is a Gradle plugin for combining a project's dependency classes and resources into a single output Jar. The combined Jar is often referred to a fat-jar or uber-jar. ... Shadowing a project output has 2 major use cases: (1) Creating an executable JAR distribution, [and] (2) Bundling and relocating common dependencies in libraries to avoid classpath conflicts."

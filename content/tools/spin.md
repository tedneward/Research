Spin is an open source framework for building and running fast, secure, and composable cloud microservices with WebAssembly. It aims to be the easiest way to get started with WebAssembly microservices, and takes advantage of the latest developments in the WebAssembly component model and Wasmtime runtime.

Spin offers a simple CLI that helps you create, distribute, and execute applications, and in the next sections we will learn more about Spin applications and how to get started.
